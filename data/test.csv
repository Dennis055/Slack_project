Any other updates on Lesson Plans/Workshops?,1
Not from me.,1
Nothing else from me,1
But I create new pr for learn theme.,1
"Yes, and it looks like @juhise submitted one about a week ago as well, thank you both!",1
I'll assign another task for next week.,1
"Whelp, I guess let's have a few minutes for open discussion, any issues on your minds?",1
Hmm I don't have any for now.,1
Nothing at the moment,1
We'll call the meeting in,1
"</meeting> Thanks, as always let us know here in the channel if anyone needs help!",1
"Well, well, well. It's weekly meeting time again!",1
"As usual, all are welcome, as we discuss the happenigns of the week past, and the week ahead, for the various support teams all over! Please do avoid threaded replies, @clorith can't keep up with them",1
"We'll be going through the agenda, as posted at https://make.wordpress.org/support/2020/02/agenda-for-february-20th-support-meeting/ (edited)",1
And first things first; would someone like to do the notes this week ?,1
supervisor @sterndata will take notes,1
I can do notes again this week,1
"(Taking notes is a great way to get more involved in a team, and there's no pre-requisites to doing so 
 )",1
Lovely! @diddledan it is,1
"All right, WordPress 5.4-beta2 went out yesterday",1
"You can read all about it at https://wordpress.org/news/2020/02/wordpress-5-4-beta-2/, and the Beata Tester plugin has been updated to make beta testing easier and more obvious! (edited)",1
"With beta2 out the door, we are moving closed to the Release Candidate stage (scheduled for March 3rd), at which point we will start workling on the Master List",1
"For those who may not be aware, with each major release of WordPress, the support team generates a primary support topic with pre-emptive responses to things we suspect users may get hung up on in the new version.",1
"I make note of it now, so that we can start subconsciously thinking of what needs to go in the list when the time is right",1
"Are there any big news in this release, besides some new bells and whistles in the block editor?",1
Site Health is more prominent than ever with a dashboard widget,1
The privacy stuff got punted?,1
"The calendar widget's markup is changing, which may or may not affect themes displaying it",1
"I don't think I've made note of any privacy things, I'd have to double check",1
There is an issue with Multi-site compatibility for the unmapping and remapping of privacy caps.,1
There are a lot of small readability type improvements.,1
"As we're moving outside of the support area it feels like, let's move on to the next item on the agenda",1
"Which is checking in with international liaisons! (courtesty ping to @tobifjellner, @hardeepasrani, @cristiano.zanca, @yui, @motchi0214, @valeriosza, @richardvd, @pmfonseca, @fernandot, @xkon, @nikolam, @abdullahramzan, @Kartik Shukla and @FahimMurshed), and of course if you're a member from a non-English speaking part of our community, but not named, please let us know how things are going, these are jsut the ones we have been introduced to so far!",1
"everything is fine on 
 forums",1
"All fine in Swedish 
  forum, except one poor user with a wiped site yesterday.",1
all fine in NL,1
"Everything is fine on 
 forums",1
"can only mention a peak in hacked sites, probably related to ThemeGrill demo importer 0day",1
"Or certain other high profiles plugins 
 there's been a few",1
"And since we're on the topic, an unannounced little side note from me here. Sharing information taht there's something going down with a plugin is great, it helps us keep on top of things, but please remain neutral, and don't go overbaord.",1
"There's been a lot of unwanted activity relating to this in the past weeks, so please keep it professional",1
"That's all the fixed stuff I had this week, so I'll open the floor up. This section allows for questions or support related items that weren't posted ot the agenda to be brought up by the general community.",1
fixed was released when wordfence released that blog,1
this has quickly turned into a support thread: https://wordpress.org/support/topic/very-good-4480/,1
"I feel like we've sort of slid out of a support question, could we move the rails back towards our area, and mayeb see if anyone else has any questions they'd like to rbing up with the group ?",1
"Since we're clearly not gettign anything more sensible and support related, I'm going to end our weekly chat there then </meeting>",1
"<meeting>
It's weekly support meeting time!",1
"This is when the support members form around the world get together, look at the week that's been, and the week ahead! All are welcome, please do try to avoid threaded replies, they're impossible to follow though",1
"First up, do we have anyone who would like to take notes ?",1
"All right, I guess we'll just kick off and see, if anyone does wantto take notes, please feel free to do so though !",1
We'll be following the agenda at https://make.wordpress.org/support/2020/02/agenda-for-february-13th-support-meeting/ (edited),1
"First things first, WordPress 5.4, beta 1, was released the other day",1
"This means I'll start nagging you all to test it if you can (don't feel pressured to do so though!), some information about the release, and how to test it can be found at https://wordpress.org/news/2020/02/wordpress-5-4-beta-1/ (edited)",1
"I am travelling, so don't have my handy list of handy pings, but I'll still say that I'd love ot hear how our international liaisons are doing. How are things for those of you in the non-English part of the support world of WordPress ?",1
"all fine 

sad to know that WCAsia 2020 been suddenly cancelled :/",1
All fine in NL,1
"Next on the agenda is checking in with international liaisons (and sending a courtesy ping to @tobifjellner, @hardeepasrani, @cristiano.zanca, @yui, @motchi0214, @valeriosza, @richardvd, @pmfonseca, @fernandot, @xkon, @nikolam, @abdullahramzan, @Kartik Shukla and @FahimMurshed whom are known to us already from the non-english speaking part of our community). Of course if you are from a non-English speaking part and are not named, we would love to hear from you and get to know you, so please let us know how things are going for you.",1
"All fine in italy 
 (edited)",1
All fine in Bangladesh,1
"Re: WCAsia, the health concerns need to take priority. It’s sad indeed. I wish everyone in the Asia region to be safe and well.",1
My new challenge is to make known the existence of a forum for pt_AO,1
Is there anything you can think of that we could help with ?,1
pt_AO for the abbreviation-challenged?,1
"Btw, all right in Brazil",1
Any other international topics we should be looking to ?,1
"all fine and lovely in 
 as always lateeeee",1
i saw the WP page in FB cancelled these meetups due to the coronavirus,1
"I think this might also be a good time to just open the floor up for any questions or concerns that are not previously mentioned in the agenda post. This is open for all users, but please do keep them about support-related topics!",1
Any other open floor tickets before I have to move to get to my gate on time ?,1
"If there's nothing else then, we can close the official meeting hours with a </meeting>, but please do continue to discuss and help each other out!",1
"It's weekly support meeting time, so come one, come all!",1
"During this hour (or less), we look at the past week, and the week ahead for the various support teams around our wonderful little planet",1
"Everyone is welcome to participate, but we do ask that you avoid threaded replies, they're terribly hard ot keep track of.",1
Let's jump straight into some General announcements,1
"Only really one lined up, a quick summary of the bug scrub/ticket triage from earlier this week, which focused on the tickets marked as high and low importance, to see if any needed re-classifying as things have changed in the time they've existed.",1
"Some were closed, some were moved to other priority labels, all in all a good session, and thanks to those who had a chance to attend and help pass judgment :)",1
Does anyone have any announcements I've missed that should be noted ?,1
"Oh, right, we're still looking to have someone volunteer to take notes for the meeting (this is not a fixed position, you're not required to do it every week, we'll put forth a call with every meeting, so if anyone is interested in taking notes, please step forth and let it be known 
 )",1
"Note taking is a great way to start getting familiar with a team and a great intro to contributing, there's no requirements on pre-existing knowledge or anything of the sorts!",1
"OK, I'll take notes.",1
I volunteer to join the committee.,1
"Next on the agenda is checking in with international liaisons (and sending a courtesy ping to @tobifjellner, @hardeepasrani, @cristiano.zanca, @yui, @motchi0214, @valeriosza, @richardvd, @pmfonseca, @fernandot, @xkon, @nikolam, @abdullahramzan, @Kartik Shukla and @FahimMurshed whom are known to us already from the non-english speaking part of our community). Of course if you are from a non-English speaking part and are not named, we would love to hear from you and get to know you, so please let us know how things are going for you.",1
"How are things going, is there anything we can help y'all with in any way, or has something exciting happened in the past week (or next week) that you would like to share ?",1
Oh. Hi all. Everything is fine in Swedish forum,1
Most of the time I find spam folder empty. Obviously all of us doing good job keeping it that way.,3
"Approving pending could let many things loose, and should be reserved those who are trusted to put it there in the first place",3
Do you have anyone in mind who you'd offer that power to that you would not trust as a mod? (I don't expect you to name names.,3
"Yeah, I check the spam queue hourly, but only when I’m online.",3
"Yeah. Spam can be very obvious, but often you need to dig deeper to really tell it apart.",3
"If I wake up before Jan, I the pending queue can be quite long. But I'm rarely up that early.",3
"I do it when I wake up, and around lunch as a minimum",3
And I'm automated at that time.,3
"Yeah, our mod team has a heavy weight towards Americas time zones.",3
When I wake up some of the pending is 6 hours old.,3
You wake up just before my lunch,3
I wasn't concerned about the 'spcial users' missing one or two as the effectiveness of faster proactivity in getting those potential spams into the queue,3
Who would have to put the role in place? It sounds like something above trac.,3
What are actionable steps that we would like to take on this ?,3
"No, making roles is literally trac tickets with patches, it's all plugins",3
Either all that ↑↑ or get a couple of new mods in Asia and Europe/Africa...,3
"Keep in mind that the forum component is the largest one at this time with the most open tickets, and there's things that I would consider more important that has been waiting for quite some time so this would not be a priority action",3
Investigate the potential of creating the new role and then creating that role then testing carefully and assigning the people,3
Sounds like the first actionable step is create a trac ticket to discuss further then and see if anyone wants to grab the reins on it. (edited),3
"All right, we've hit the hour, so first step, make a ticket for async discussions on it so that those not able to attend can voice their opinions.",3
We'll determine followup steps depending on the outcome there.,3
Any take-aways from that discussion right before the meeting? (like a new Pre-defined reply or something?),3
Sure. Go ahead and write it.,3
Jan's follow-up reply was pretty good.,3
Ha! I'm not known for my tact. Quite the opposite...,3
"A predefined reply seems like it might not help. Each time the discussion has come up, it's been different enough that I couldn't (off the top of my head right this moment) think of a predefined reply that would answer it.",3
"I think the key is to acknowledge the actual problem - if we know what it is.
Explaining that the site is misconfigured is helpful.",3
Many of us use our own pre-defines for those things we touch upon often.,3
"The point, too, is that we're not WIX and don't control user sites.",3
"Also, specifically remembering that users do not understand how the ""supply chain"" works for WordPress helps.",3
"""supply chain""?",3
what I think actually happened in that case was the spam email referenced a form on a website... Could have been any website. we can't control what someone writes in a email. I don't think the form had anything to do with the generation of that spam.,3
We're also not a company and that needs to be clearer. This is a community.,3
"That WordPress.org sites are not hosted by WordPress.org, @t-p",3
"I received an email along those lines - someone wrote to the Polymer Project mailing list complaining that ""Polymer is hacking my system. Stop it.""",3
"And how to find the right ""person"" to report an issue an ""outsider"" discovered. Outsider, as in, someone that doesn't use WordPress and/or doesn't own the site where the issue occurs",3
Is my answer for https://wordpress.org/support/topic/question-about-appropriateness-of-posts-here/ appropriate? (As I'm the one who archived the OP's other post.),3
... so it's not just W.org that gets misidentified,3
We can have a support/doc/article that explains it better. But I find that people and their roles should not be defined by other people's misunderstandings.,3
That was a good reply Steve.,3
Doug said recently that they still get e-mails at WooCommerce that someone's product hasn't been delivered...,3
It definitely happens.,3
I felt I actually covered the 'not hosted here' and the 'right way to report a received spam' and 'who to report to'.,3
We have this https://docs.woocommerce.com/document/built-with-woocommerce/,3
"I skimmed it (note: I barely woke up when I skimmed it so...) and didn't feel that the replies showed any empathy that the person was obviously getting so much spam that they took time to track all this down and thought they found the right people. It felt like we said, Tough luck. Not our problem.",3
Which opens another idea: these aren't forums converting people to WordPress. I'm not taking a dig at anyone but the forums work because of their focus for support.,3
"Which opens another idea: these aren't forums converting people to WordPress
They should never be a barrier to other people trying to convert people to WordPress though.",3
It's not a barrier to be focused on solving user's problems and helping.,3
these aren't forums converting people to WordPress,3
"They're support forums, we're here to help users, and we can be good community stewards by being kind to them and helping them even if they're not using WordPress, so they knwo where to go",3
AFAIK the forums are focused on solving tangible (that's important) problems users have with WordPress.,3
I was trying to explain that the forums are for user's of WordPress who have problems. If the OP isn't using WordPress then that topic is kinda circular and pointless. NOT BEING RUDE.,3
Then let someone else answer,3
"If the OP is not important to you (which is just fine, nothing wrong with that), they may be to someone else.",3
Even if that requires collab with marketing.,3
So... my answer and attempts to help is invalid? That's a great motivator.,3
"It's important to remember that people outside of this immediate circle don't know our rules/policies, and come seeking help with for their problems. It doesn't matter if we think that those problems are 'off topic'; we still need to give them a good experience. We can definitely defer/delegate on that.",3
Not at all what I said,3
"But it's easy to say ""I'm sorry this is happening"" and help the person find the right people to help.",3
"@jan_dembowski By providing good, clear, support, and helping people, we help with WP retention, fwiw.",3
Agreed.,3
So we are converting people to stay,3
"I'm saying if it isn't important to you, that will come through to the OP.",3
It was important to me to try and explain to the OP. (edited),3
"First up this week, a proposed addition to the guidelines, after observing for some time that links lead to confusion and misunderstandings back and forth, let's note down something set in stone about them to hopefully also make moderator tasks more consistent.",3
"I made a proposal along the lines of
 Public links in plugin or theme support topics may only be posted if they are to the creators official site or support resource.",3
"Basically, other users can then also provide the links to documentation, but only if they are on the official site for support/documentation of that plugin/theme",3
I think that is a very reasonable suggestion.,3
W.org links should also be allowed methinks,3
Or 3rd party sites such as wpbeginer.,3
This way there is no grey area of linking to your own personal site because it has the documentation as well,3
I often point people at real W.org docs to explain a feature of my plugin,3
s/wpbeginer/reputable 3rd party site/,3
"W.org links are self-proclaimed OK, always, but yes",3
"So, what about a less well-known third party site, Jan?",3
"No, now wpbeginners, nothing else external at all",3
Who decides what is reputable?,3
That is good idea. Now it reminds me there will be contributor day at WCAsia. Who are coming?,2
"Yeah, it's barely one month away!",2
"Ok, interesting!",2
Are you going @chetan200891?,2
"Yes, I am going",2
Will have to give it a miss this year but will try for next year.,2
https://2020.asia.wordcamp.org/contributor-day/ Here is schedule. But I hope we can get training table there. (edited),2
"Do we need to reach out in #wcasia to see who we can talk to about arranging that, Chetan?",2
"I'll be at WordCamp Lancaster PA March 14th & WordCamp DC March 27-29, 2020.",2
Yes we should.,2
I have asked two people but waiting for reply since few days.,2
"I’m on the org team for WordCamp Chicago, if any interest for a meetup or someting.",2
May 2 -3,2
"OK, @chetan200891 let's go ahead and ask in the public channel, sometimes that's better to get the right people",2
"Though, maybe wait till a reasonable hour for Asia",2
"Scott and Courtney, we'd definitely appreciate your assistance with setting up Training for your Contributor days. As organizers, you'll probably be too busy to actually run the table, do you know anyone local who might want to join up ahead of your camps?",2
Due to my time zone the hours adjustment hasn't made a big difference so I'm not too worried about changing the time.,2
I missed most of last week’s session cause of daylight saving but have amended this moving forward. Probably just need a prompt next time we change over.,2
"For those of us in the western half of North America, it's quite early in the morning. I know @aurooba and I at least are affected",2
"The meeting time is OK to me, and I think it's OK in my timezone. (edited)",2
How early @Jesse Owens,2
"6AM for me, 5 for anyone in California or Pacific areas",2
Ouch!,2
Here's its 6:40PM in India,2
"Here, Iran, is 4.40 PM",2
"I am good with the current schedule, here in Colombia is 8:00",2
If it makes sense to move the meeting back an hour then I don't mind.,2
5 am is a bit early!,2
We have members from almost every corner of the globe so it's especially tough to come to a consensus. We'll leave the meeting at the current time for next week and let team members who weren't here today comment on the blog post.,2
Meeting time Ok for me 6:40PM in india,2
"As far as the time change adjustment:
The current proposal is to move the meeting to 1400 UTC. If this time does not work for you, please comment on the blog post:
https://make.wordpress.org/training/2019/11/14/training-team-meeting-agenda-14-november-2019/",2
"WCUS starts on 1 November, and contributor day is the third",2
Not long. I will endeavor to get it done by then.,2
Not long at all! Time is flying by.,2
"OK, Julie and I will work to get your contribution reviewed so we can move forward with it",2
"Hauwa, looks like Julie took a look at your updates to What is CSS late last night/early morning for my timezone, I'll go ahead and set up the Lesson Plan repository. What other help do you need on this lesson plan?",2
Yes just picked up on that. I’m familiar with Github so I’m assuming that the notes on how to complete the Lesson plan will be there.,2
"More or less, yes. When a new lesson plan gets created, we make a new repository for it using a template:
https://github.com/wptrainingteam/what-is-css",2
"So the next step is to fork that, translate your lesson plan into Markdown inside README.md, and submit a pull request",2
"Ok thanks. Will get on that during the week and if I need help, I’ll reach out on the slack channel.",2
"are there plans to ""reactify"" other parts of wp backend?",2
There always are.,2
Are there any specific features we need to target to improve our knowledge when testing?,2
"I think they'll be fine, with a quick glance yeah",4
"OK, those PR's have been merged now!",4
Sure is,4
"(And no, it's not because I don't want to, but I really want more folks to get more involved 
 ) (edited)",4
C#,4
There is also things like new filters for plugins to add user meta fields to that need to be included in the export.,4
right,4
"hopefully, Twenty Sixteen will not be bundled.",4
"Think of it as “Developers, the next time you can find time to turn your shortcode into a block, please do.” right now.
We have not yet reached “Users, panic and find an alternative for the shortcode plugin you’re using.”",4
backwards compatibility (probably),4
most likely for a long time,4
how often do regular users check server logs,4
Regular non tech users? Probably rarely,4
slim to none,4
dont really use GDPR cookie consent stuff :),4
I’ll put that in the “Open Floor” notes,4
Sounds good,4
This is a good read: https://www.welcometothejungle.com/en/articles/btc-discussion-open-source-maintenance,4
Is the issue with ThemeGrill fixed?,4
1.6.2 fixes it,4
was it something that was in other importers also?,4
duplicator,4
"Yes, duplicator been fixed too.",4
probably before that blog was posted,4
but not in the WP importer?,4
There's no known issues wit hthe WP Importer,4
"The plugin/theme auto-update thing got punted to 5.5, right?",4
even though I asked the reviewer to open a support request,4
"p.s: I think their issues are valid, nonetheless",4
done -- replied and closed,4
"Just of matter of who’s doing it, and when.",4
comments for example,4
waiting for spring strings,4
@marcio-zebedeu is your W.org nickname the same as here (for notes)?,4
portugese angola?,4
username wp.org @ marcio-zebedeu,4
danke,4
done with that yet?,4
I really believe that forums and docs should be language-based as I said before somewhere.,4
"Also, a https://dev.to article? (edited)",4
might be,4
I merged it already,5
"Very nice, thanks!",5
@Iqbal Bary have you had a chance to check out https://make.wordpress.org/training/handbook/getting-started/,5
"Not yet, I’m checking it now",5
"I'll go ahead and merge it into the Dev branch, and move it over to Instructional Review.",5
"Thanks for joining us! I saw your issue regarding the XML import for the development environment, we do need to get that updated. In the meantime, you can use the WP-CLI commands to properly import the site content (see step 7)
https://github.com/wptrainingteam/learn-theme-beta/blob/master/readme.md",5
Are you not getting lesson plans imported?,5
"The issue was regarding changing the Post Type slug from lesson_plan to lesson-plan, the XML import file wasn't updated after we made that change",5
I had same issue for quick fix. I have deactivated Jetpack and Activated again. That worked for me. You should give it a try.,5
"No there isn't any conflicts, I create new page for 'Workshop Ideas' and also I edit header and footer file in themes folder, but just a bit.",5
What's the difference between do_shortcode and the proposed new apply_shortcode ?,5
"No difference, it's just an alias to make it more obvious comapred to other similar functions",5
there isn’t any. it’s simply an alias,5
ideally we’ll be teaching apply_shortcode going forward to be correct,5
so do_shortcode will be deprecated?,5
"eventually, but not immediately",5
Is there a guideline for taking notes?,5
"Nope, you're pretty free, it's basically jsut summarising what is said",5
This requires people who have code knowledge – yes?,5
"You're not expected to have integral knowledge of code, or the trac or anything, you'll be asked to provide feedback and thoughts on tickets, and if we think they are worth pursuing, and how important they are to us (edited)",5
How would someone peruse these tickets before hand?,5
"For anyone who's never taken part in a bug scrub/ticket triage before, what essentially happens is that the facilitator (in this case, me, or someone else as well if they'd like to, we're very inclusive here) prepares a set of tickets ahead of time they'd like to consider..
During the hour, the tickets are provided, a quick summary of what they are about is providfed, and then input from the other participants is taken into account to make sure the best choise is made for how to proceed with it later",5
"Tickets can be viewed ahead of time at this link: https://meta.trac.wordpress.org/query?status=accepted&status=assigned&status=new&status=reopened&status=reviewing&component=Support+Forums&order=priority
(it's a long link, don't be discouraged by that, it just says that it should only show tickets that are not yet resolved)",5
and you can comment on those at any time,5
"which leads me to my open floor rant:  <rant> If you're referring a poster elsewhere (to a sub-forum or external site) give them the link.  If you don't have time to look it up, don't respond.  </rant>",5
"I agree with Steve. If you want to help them then help them as best you can, don't leave them hanging.",5
"I joke about it but ""Embrace your inner Canadian"" is a thing. We're trying to help and educate. Read the replies, everyone there including the OP is trying.",5
