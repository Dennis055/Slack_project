Here is the agenda for today: https://make.wordpress.org/accessibility/2020/02/28/accessibility-team-meeting-agenda-february-28-2020/,1
"(on 
 and a terrible connection)",1
Next up: Accessibility team goals for WP 5.5,1
"well, I’ll summarize that in the meeting recap",1
Next item?,1
Update on WP Accessibility Day,1
@joedolson,1
"It's moving forward. Goal is to announce on March 25th; there's a design in the works, so we're on target.",1
The website is currently under construction,1
"Next meeting will be on Tuesday, 3 March; if anybody still needs to vote on the time, do it today!",1
In #accessibility-events,1
"Not much else to report right now - we've got a budget mostly worked out, looking for sponsors to cover the captioning & transcription costs, etc.",1
do we have any Gutenberg issue/pull request to discuss? (edited),1
"If not, we can directly open the floor",1
"I believe that #49517 needs some discussion with the editor team, although I think it's a very clear cut issue from the a11y side.",1
If @ella is still around?,1
"If not, then I don't think there's anything to discuss here.",1
"Alright, let’s close our weekly meeting!",1
</meeting>,1
"@here Ok, let’s get started then. Who is around?
Today we’ll be following the proposed agenda here: https://make.wordpress.org/accessibility/2020/02/20/accessibility-team-meeting-agenda-february-21-2020/",1
"Ok, topic numero uno:
Discussion on the Navigation Menu block testing.",1
A few weeks ago we started doing a11y testing on a new navigation block in Gutenberg. We added our results and feedback here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/1/d/1yFCFlPK78Ryl7WT9iRhn4Xe0PpWvnzAKSzBLi6L8GHY/edit?usp=sharing,1
"Going over the results, I think consensus was that keyboard navigation was dificult",1
and it looks like the block’s release was postponed due to it not being ready for prime time: https://make.wordpress.org/core/2020/02/07/navigation-block-exclusion-from-wp-5-4/,1
"while the reason to postpone it was not our tests, I think this works out well timing wise. The team working on it will have enough time to go over our results and review those issues.
Anyone has anything else to add?",1
"Correct, @jeryj. We postponed it because while it is usable... it wasn't yet useful without proper Header/Footer areas to put it in.",1
I want to thank everyone for testing this out!,1
"Ok, thanks again to everyone who was able to help!",1
Thanks for those that dove into this.,1
"If there are items that are smaller that don’t need as much direction regarding the keyboard nav, I have time today to look at it. I was wanting to help fix keyboard navigation with the navigation block, but am nowhere near knowledgeable enough with the accessibility of it to know what to actually do. I’ll follow along in the Github issues to hopefully help out and learn more 
 Thanks for your work on it!",1
"That’s great @jeryj, thank you! Once I have those issues up in the GitHub repo I’ll share them here.",1
Let’s move on then.,1
Next item is Discussion of team involvement in Gutenberg development,1
"ok, let’s move on while we still have time",1
next item is a Trac issue: #48894,1
@joedolson @Dani Hooven @afercia would you be up for following up on this?,1
I can try to dedicate some time now that I’m relatively settled down after my moving.,1
"LOL! And on that note, let’s finish our meeting then.
Thank you all for coming. Hope everyone has a great weekend 
</meeting>",1
Would anyone like to help with creating an issue as Mark suggests and adding our feedback there?,1
"Anyways, we’re derailing",1
But we should probably move on in the meeting.,1
"I’m going to move us along then, we have more topics on the agenda. Next item is feedback on a new TabPanel component: https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/13587
Feedback is required on how keyboard navigation between tabs should behave. Currently on the editor sidebar, tabbing moves you to the next tab, but an enter is required to open such tab. There’s a new TabPanel component being developed that started by adhering to WAI-ARIA practices, where keyboard navigation differs a bit. If I understand correctly, navigating between tabs is done with the keyboard arrows, and tabbing enters you in the tab’s content. 
The question being asked is, which method should they use. (edited)",1
"We’re way past the hour, but before we leave, I’d like to remind everyone to vote for a date for the next WPAD planning meeting. You can vote here https://wordpress.slack.com/archives/CM6KEHYCR/p1581612505083800
 Thank you all for coming. Hope y’all have an excellent weekend. </meeting>
Please continue the current conversation, the channel is open 24/7.",1
"We’ll start the team meeting in a couple of minutes. Let’s give everyone time to refill their 
 / 
 / 
 /etc.",1
Here’s today’s agenda: https://make.wordpress.org/accessibility/2020/02/06/accessibility-team-meeting-agenda-february-7-2020/,1
Thank you all for being here! Let’s get started then…,1
"First item on the agenda is Discussion on the accessibility status of the Gutenberg sidebar.
This is a topic we started discussing last meeting and decided to spend more time today going over it.",1
I know @afercia has some comments on this.,1
Ah well I can just repeat what I said last week,1
"Sorry, I didn’t expect to be pinged",1
"my apologies 
 , but if you don’t mind repeating what you said, so we can frame the conversation",1
"Basically not much has changed in the way users can navigate back and forth from the content to the sidebar.
If I’m not mistaken, there’s just one more button now that allows to “jump” to the sidebar.
I’d argue this doesn’t address one of the broader issues we, as a team, pointed to since a few months.",1
"I’d also like to remind it’s more or less 10 months this team outlines a few, broader, issues in Gutenberg that are mainly related to the general design and layout. 
 No much progress, so far.",1
@nrqsnchz Are you willing to help work on visualization and help us make a proposal?,1
absolutely!,1
OK. Andrea - will you work with me to write up the text & structural changes portion? Then I'll work with Enrique to create design proposals to go with that.,1
"speaking of beta, and seeing that there’s little time left, I want to skip to the Status update on 5.4 tickets.",1
@audrasjb are you around to give us an update?,1
"There is currently 36 tickets in the milestone
- 5 are closed as fixed
- 4 open tickets are tagged for commit",1
"Beta 1 is planned for February 11, so next bug scrub (next Monday at 17:00 UTC) will probably be a “punting party”.",1
are there any tickets that could move forward with a little push?,1
"(it’s a reference for @afercia as we have a FRA-ITA rugby match on Sunday 
 )",1
"haha, sounds like it’ll be a fun match",1
"Yes, everthing still in the milestone “can” land in 5.4, so feel free to help on them",1
"my knowledge of Trac is still very limited, can you share a link with all those tickets, @audrasjb ? (edited)",1
https://core.trac.wordpress.org/query?status=accepted&status=assigned&status=new&status=reopened&status=reviewing&keywords=~commit&focuses=~accessibility&milestone=5.4&col=id&col=summary&col=status&col=owner&col=type&col=priority&col=milestone&order=priority,1
sure: https://core.trac.wordpress.org/query?status=accepted&status=assigned&status=new&status=reopened&status=reviewing&focuses=~accessibility&milestone=5.4&col=id&col=summary&col=status&col=owner&col=type&col=priority&col=milestone&order=priority,1
ah,1
I posted the ones ready for commit; so those are two separate lists.,1
"ah, got it. Thank you both!",1
"Ok, so if anyone has some free time, those tickets from the link @audrasjb just shared could need your help (edited)",1
@afercia & @joedolson do you have some time available for commit actions in the next few days?,1
"@sergey is always a big help for us too, but he will probably have a lot to do, as 5.4 core tech lead",1
Unfortunately I’m a bit short on time. Real life happens. I’d suggest to offer cookies to @sergey for his assistance and help,1
"and we’re past the hour, so time to end out meeting </meeting>
Thank you all for joining! Remember the channel is always open, so feel free to stick around. (edited)",1
Let’s start the meeting while waiting for joe. <meeting>,1
Welcome everyone! Here’s today’s Agenda: https://make.wordpress.org/accessibility/2020/01/30/accessibility-team-meeting-agenda-january-31-2020/,1
Let's move on - anybody want to comment on the ticket?,1
"If nobody volunteers to comment, I'll take care of it after the meeting.",1
I can do it! Sorry - got distracted.,1
#48709,1
Next up: https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/9457,1
I'll leave this to @afercia to dive in -,1
All right - I'll mention to @nrqsnchz to add this item to next week's agenda.,1
Last item!,1
Testing the Navigation Block.,1
"Finally, Open Floor - anybody have anything to raise?",1
let’s get started with out weekly meeting then,1
"while everyone joins, here’s today’s agenda: https://make.wordpress.org/accessibility/2020/01/23/accessibility-team-meeting-agenda-january-24-2020/",1
let’s get started then,1
first item on the agenda is Update on 5.4 trac tickets,1
I’d like to start by thanking @audrasjb for organizing and running additional bug scrubs,1
the schedule can be found here: https://make.wordpress.org/accessibility/2020/01/19/wordpress-5-4-accessibility-focused-bug-scrubs-agenda/,1
Last week we were at 40 accessibility focused tickets still open in the milestone.,1
Today we are at 36 open tickets.,1
"Reminder: Beta 1 is planned for February 11, 2020. It’s our deadline for committing patches into core.",1
Next bug scrub is planned on Tuesday 28th at 17:00 UTC.,1
"thanks for the reminders and info @audrasjb!
If you can join a bug scrub, make sure to mark it on you calendars",1
let’s move on then,1
next item is Update on the last WPAD planning meeting,1
last week we had our 3rd (?) planning meeting,1
these meetings happen in #accessibility-events,1
things are starting to take shape and we already have a few folks volunteering to specific teams,1
"and most important, we have a date",1
@joedolson I’ll let you share the date with everyone on the team,1
"The intended date is September 26th, 2020. That could change, so I wouldn't start promoting it yet, but I don't think a change is very likely. However, planning still has a long way to go!",1
"However, with 8 months remaining, and given the current rate of development and participation, I feel that this is a very realistic and plausible timeline.",1
"The date was selected to avoid major holidays & WordPress events (releases, camps, etc.), but - obviously - there will still be conflicts that arise. We do what we can!",1
"I can add that folks who signed up for website design and development have already a scheduled meeting for next week, so we can start working on that!",1
"I’ll move us along then, next on the agenda is Follow up of the Gutenberg block focus project",1
let’s move on to the next item: Help testing the navigation block,1
the design team is asking for help with testing the navigation block,1
We’re almost out of time… does anyone have anything for Open floor?,1
"On that note, let’s end the meeting then 
Remember to go to #accessibility-events and vote for the dates that work best for you for next planning meeting.
Also, if you can help with bug scrubs, check out the schedule on https://make.wordpress.org/accessibility/2020/01/19/wordpress-5-4-accessibility-focused-bug-scrubs-agenda/
Hope everyone has a great weekend!

"<community-team-chat>
We are kicking off Community Team Chat now. React to this message with your flags so we can see where you’re all from!
For anyone who is joining for the first time (whether active or observing), this is a meeting where community deputies discuss issues that have come up, WordCamps/meetups they are working on, and generally keeping up to date on what is going on in this corner of the WordPress project.
Most contributors on this team are volunteers, but we do have a handful of people who are sponsored to do this work. Ask questions as you have them, but remember we are family-friendly around here.
Reminder: we discuss issues during the chats, but we make decisions on the community blog.
Today’s agenda is here: https://make.wordpress.org/community/2020/02/19/community-team-chat-agenda-20-february-2020/ (edited)",1
I am still doing vettings of meetups and happy with the news in the request form for new meetups,1
"I’ve done mostly WCEU related stuff, some vetting and HS triage. Also continued mentoring WordCamp Aalborg and Mannheim - both camps are in process of confirming the venue and wrangling budget for review.",1
"I’ve been mentoring a few WordCamps, including WC Miami which is happening at the end of this month! Also, ramping up with WCUS, supporting the Diverse Speaker working group, and, of course, vetting applications, doing orientations, and HS triage.",1
"Mostly working on WC Asia cancellation things, did mentor check-in with Bengaluru and some regular tasks.",1
"I've been working mostly with WC Asia over the past week to assist with cancellation tasks and get things set up for the 2021 event - also the usual keeping things going in HS, etc.",1
My time is split between WCEU and Core.,1
"Not enough work on other Community issues for me right now, but I’ll try to squeeze in at least one vetting over the weekend (edited)",1
"I work for WordCamp Asia. Our organizer team had a mess last week and this week
 But we are learning a lot from it.
I also received Code of Conduct training for WordCamp Asia.
And a regular meeting with Deputy in Japan. We are also consulting with organizers about hosting a Japanese Meetup. About holding, postponement or cancellation depending on the situation at COVID-19.",1
"sounds like we are busy with WordCamps, so I guess we can say that the season has started!",1
"Even tho the news about cancellation of WC Asia was sad, seeing the response and all the support for organisers from WordPress community made me so happy",1
"Okay! Moving forward. We have some P2 posts needing review and feedback. Even commenting +1 or something short to these posts is really valuable and helpful, so please take some time after our team chat to check these posts out.",1
"2019 Annual WordPress Meetup Organizer Survey https://make.wordpress.org/community/2020/02/16/2019-annual-wordpress-meetup-organizer-survey/
Annual Meetup Organizer survey has been sent out! If you are a Meetup Organizer, please feel free to share the survey link with your co-organizers. (edited)",1
"Worth saying, also survey for meetup members is still open for business https://make.wordpress.org/community/2020/02/04/2019-annual-wordpress-meetup-member-survey/ (edited)",1
"I’m busy with WCEU and WCCA stuff, orientations, HS tickets, WC site creations, etc.",1
"WordCamp and Meetup application vetting sprints – February 2020 https://make.wordpress.org/community/2020/02/07/wordcamp-and-meetup-application-vetting-sprints-february-2020/
We currently have a backlog of WordCamp and Meetup applications. We would like to request the help of all deputies to help us stay responsive to community members, and to help keep our queues moving forward.
That’s why we are having two more vetting sprints this month: Friday, February 21, 2020, 13:00 UTC and Tuesday, February 25, 2020, 16:00 UTC (edited)",1
"Thank you @angelasjin for putting vetting sprints together for this month! Let’s have some again next month, is anyone willing to put sprints together for March?",1
maybe someone on Americas friendly meeting will volunteer,1
Then we have a bit more highlighted P2 posts this time,1
"Applying lessons from agile to event organization: the sprint retro https://make.wordpress.org/community/2020/02/17/applying-lessons-from-agile-to-event-organization-the-sprint-retro/
Jenny Beaumont shared this very interesting post on how WordCamp organizers can improve the way team works. Worth reading! (edited)",1
"love that whole post from jenny - its a great format for retrospective for projects and, in our case, wordcamp organising teams",1
i would encourage any organising team to run through that after the event - it will really help with identifying things that can be improved for the next one,1
Totally! Usually we just throw up an amazing event but forgot to gather feedback properly after it.,1
yeah exactly,1
"do_action hackathon Cheltenham 2019 – building four websites in a day! https://make.wordpress.org/community/2020/02/13/do_action-hackathon-cheltenham-2019-building-four-websites-in-a-day/
Very nice recap on how do_action hackathon Cheltenham 2019 went! I’m like thiiiiiiiiiiiiis exicted about seeing more and more do_action events takign place 
 (edited)",1
Hugh might know; how many do_action events have taken place after launching the event series?,1
oh id have to go and check that - its a manual count,1
but id say about 40 or so altogether over 3 years,1
"Changes in Meetup Organizer Application form https://make.wordpress.org/community/2020/02/19/changes-in-meetup-organizer-application-form/
Some changes were made to the meetup organizer application form and hopefully deputies don’t need to ask more information from applicants so often anymore. (edited)",1
"As a side note: I’m also going to review the fields on both WordCamp and Meetup edit view on central.wc.org and see if we can make those simpler. I’ll share the results for discussion on P2 
 There’s also issue for making the original application more easy to read.",1
"Community Team Reps for 2020 https://make.wordpress.org/community/2020/02/06/community-team-reps-for-2020-2/
Have you already met our team reps for 2020? If you haven’t take a look on the post and get to know with Mary and Cami. (edited)",1
"Last but not least, update from very important working group…",1
"Recap of the Diverse Speaker Training group (#wpdiversity) on Feb 12, 2020 https://make.wordpress.org/community/2020/02/13/recap-of-the-diverse-speaker-training-group-wpdiversity-on-feb-12-2020/ (edited)",1
"The Diverse Speaker Training working group is awesome! We’ve been working on updating our tools and training, and are working on some EOY reporting.",1
"If you’re interested in participating in the working group, we’d love to have you! And, if you’d like to run the workshop in your meetup, we are so ready to help you with that",1
"After linking to multiple P2 posts so fast, it’s time for open floor! So for anyone who is here - is there anything youd like to say or talk about?",1
"since WC Asia isn't happening, I know a few contributor teams are organising online contributor events in place of the contributor day that would have happened",1
"i know of Theme Review, Polyglots and (I think) Marketing",1
"we don't have one planned for Community, but if anyone feels like leading a vetting sprint or some other contributor work this weekend, then please do! (and post about it on the p2 
 )",1
There’s still time to fire your questions and thoughts on open floor. Anyone have something in their mind?,1
Tl;DR the WCEU Contributing Team is aiming to make Contributor Day at WCEU a pivotal point for how Contributor Days are done,1
"We would like to get very efficient at onboarding 
 So people don’t only get pumped on the day, but they take the day as the starting point for a long-lasting, sustainable contribution practice",1
"In the next few weeks we will ping the Team Reps for each Make team to get comments, ideas, onboarding instructions, tasks, etc…",1
We are creating onboarding guides in the WP.org GitHub repo,1
"generic for tools that are used by multiple teams
specific for teams",1
"These are not duplicated of the Get Started at Contributor day guides that many teams have (and probably need to be reviewed) and they are on GitHub because they are
Team agnostic
Translatable
(edited)",1
Thanks for your attention,1
"Oh, related to Contributor Day this call from WCEU is also worth mentioning. Spread it to your local communities 
  https://2020.europe.wordcamp.org/2020/02/15/call-for-contributor-stories/ (edited)",1
i always love seeing this prep for WCEU come up at this time of year,1
we have few minutes left…,1
Remember how we discussed about improving the application experience by sending automatic follow-ups to applicants if their application has been waiting for too long?,1
Some time ago awesome #meta-wordcamp fixed the confirmation messages and those are now coming to our HS,1
…but we still need the automatic follow-ups if that message has been sitting for too long,1
"and actually we need also slight change to our process. When we see that message in HS, link to the ticket should be updated to application for further communication",1
"mmm, this might need some more thinking actually because we are not currently using the HS API.",1
I’m just talking my thoughts out loud here,1
"Well, we are near the one hour mark and it means wrapping up this session of community team meeting.",1
"Thank you all for being here today! This meeting will be held with same agenda later today at 20:00 UTC for covering americas friendly timezone.
Needless to say, if anyone has questions or feedbacks, do not hesitate to comment, someone will always respond

Todays agenda can be found here: https://make.wordpress.org/community/2020/01/29/youth-event-working-group-formerly-kids-chat-agenda-thursday-13-february-2020/ (edited),1
Updates from the past month: Feel free to note anything you have been working on or accomplished in January,1
The team now has an official Orientation being finalized and should be ready very soon. @camikaos and I have been working to get a snippet for the main WC orientations setup too.,1
I’ve been acting as a mentor for Sandy in leading the working group and discussing program goals for the year.,1
"And there are a few solid goals that we will talk about shortly 
 Huge kudos to Cami for all the help guiding us as a team to success!",1
With that I am opening the floor for discussion for the next bit if anyone has anything at all to discuss regarding the Working Group.,1
What’s the time commitment for both the mentor role and the WG role ?   Asking for a friend.,1
Mentorship is a bit more time consuming. That you are looking at checking in with the camp every couple weeks to make sure they are on track and can ask any questions that might arise.,1
The WG really is what you can give it. If you have 1 hour bi-weekly awesome. If it is more or less fine too!,1
We use a Trello board to keep track and Google Docs to keep everything open to the team,1
I’ll ponder.  I may put my name forward.,1
I know there are others who may not have been able to join today and that is okay. You can leave your comments in threads and I will add them to the P2 recap post tomorrow afternoon.,1

I do believe that there will be a mass update (manual) of Global Sponsors.   It would be nice if Organizers did it to help us all.  @Courtney P.K. would be the one with information on that,1
Yes I already informed WC Paris and Antwerp about it.,1
"Hello @deputies! We’re kicking off our Community Team Chat now. We have these meetings at both 11:00 UTC and 20:00. Same agenda, same discussions, just different people!",1

"Next the agenda is the usual Deputy Check-in. What are you working on, and how’s it going? Do you have any blockers that your teammates can help you with?",1
"Been getting back into the swing of things for the year with a strong focus on mentoring WC Asia (which is coming together really well!) as well as getting things in place, like the team rep voting and such",1
I have been busy with WordCamp Asia. A lot of things going on now as we are getting closer to the event. A lot excitement and a lot of work as well,1
"I’ve been mentoring and working closely with a few WordCamps, and am very excited to ramp up organizing for WCUS 2020! And usual work with HS and orientations.",1
I have been working on some mentoring of WCs and busy with WordCamp Asia as the event is getting closer!,1

"Next up, WordCamp and Meetup application vetting sprints! https://make.wordpress.org/community/2020/01/08/wordcamp-and-meetup-application-vetting-sprint/",1
"Shout out to @sippis for making this post! 

Vetting sprints not only help maintain our queues, but it’s really fun to do some vetting work together, and it’s an excellent place to learn and ask questions if you are a newer deputy. Check out when upcoming sprints are on this post, and join us if you can.",1
Next on our agenda is HIghlighted P2 posts.,1
Our last highlighted P2 post is the WordPress meetup organizer newsletter for December 2019: https://make.wordpress.org/community/2019/12/22/wordpress-meetup-organizer-newsletter-december-2019/,1
"All joking aside, there is some really good information in there, so do check it out! (edited)",1
"on that newsletter ^ meetup.com had a temporary issue with their messaging system and that message actually didn't send out to anyone 
 (edited)",1
"they have since fixed the issue, but the only place the december newsletter is available is on the p2",1
proposal to agenda: scouting meetup.com alternatives,1
"that aside, I just posted a p2 for collecting more ideas for the january newsletter - https://make.wordpress.org/community/2020/01/16/meetup-organizer-newsletter-suggestions-for-january-2020/Will close comments on 20th and will publish by 21st - and hopefully Meetup.com will oblige",1
"That brings us to the end of our agenda, although I see that @sippis has added a comment about WordPress Leaders Nominated for CMX Awards: https://wordpress.org/news/2020/01/wordpress-leaders-nominated-for-cmx-awards/",1
"Our very own @chanthaboune and @andreamiddleton were nominated for the first ever Community Industry Awards! Votes are open now, so you can vote for Andrea and Josepha if you so choose",1
"Before we open this to any other additional topics, I’d like to remind you one last time to vote for Community Team Reps here: https://make.wordpress.org/community/2020/01/15/community-team-reps-submit-your-votes/",1
Time for open floor! Are there any additional topics that anyone would like to bring up or discuss?,1
"Alright, I think that brings this bi-weekly chat to a close. Thank you all for being here today! We’ll see you here again for another team meeting in a couple of weeks.",1
"Do we have a facilitator today? I’m sorry, last week has been a major time sink in handling WC Asia’s cancellation this year so I didn’t have time to write any agenda",1
I have a few things we could discuss and close today early,1
@estelaris wanted to discuss something today,1
"Other than that, we don't have any agenda",1
"Oh, @leogermani worked on handbook",1
I just wanted also to briefly talk about the document I started and check if ww have a plan we can agree on,1
Let’s start with that,1
Go ahead @leogermani,1
I guess we can move on to the next topic,1
So quick thing - I'm sorry we had to cancel WordCamp Asia for this year,1
I'm really sorry @zzap is there and both @atachibana and I couldn't fly over,1
But this does mean all the WC Asia deadlines can now be shifted long term to WCEU,1
Can I go now?,1
Anyone has anything to bring up?,1
"Just one quick thing: I was responsible to reach the #meta team to ask them for our stats. I did, but still didn't get anything... they didn't know who have that access and I'm still trying",1
"I attended WCVienna this past weekend. On Sunday, I planned having a working session with a group of people that showed up. We ended up having an interactive session, very active with about 11 or 15 participants where we reviewed a block of articles and classified them into a proper category/subcategory. The discussion was very interesting, the most important outcome were: 1. Some articles have titles that don't make sense (there were suggestions to new names), 2. there are articles in HelpHub that still have outdated (read very outdated) information and 3. there are unnecessary articles that only list links to other articles",1
"Notes, no. But I'll be happy to type them up",1
Post it in p2?,1
I do have a spreadsheet where we are working from,1
https://tinyurl.com/tvf4vxw,1
I noticed that it is an awesome exercise when oyu have several people with different set of skills,1
as they don't seem to look at the user of WP.org/documentation the same way,1
we started from defining our user,1
"Badges
So I'm pretty sure @coffee2code updated the Team and Contributor badges. If you still don't have them, please let me know.
Scott has also given me a list of people that probably shouldn't be holding on to a Team badge because of being inactive.
Many of them will get removed but I am hesistant to remove it from past team leads.",1
It's 2 mins over our hour so I'm closing the meeting,1
If someone wants to volunteer to faciliate the next meeting,1
Please just volunteers in here,1
"<meeting type=""docs"">",1
Who is around? while everyone is arriving. Do we have a volunteer to take notes today?,1
"I can take notes, although it being my first time doing so who do I chat with to review at the end?",1
"This is not in the agenda, but I guess it's been a good idea to start by sharing status updates. What do you think? @atachibana do you have the numbers for devHub redirection? (edited)",1
Before that I’d like to ask @valentinbora to introduce his great activities. (edited),1
Thanks Akira.,1
Let's discuss the topics in the agenda and we get back to this on open floor then.,1
First topic: HelpHub (User Docs) Survey,1
there is a p2 post to gather feedback around it: https://make.wordpress.org/docs/2020/02/04/request-for-comment-questions-ideas-for-our-upcoming-user-survey/,1
As we see @bph and @felipeelia did great jobs. Thank you! (edited),1
"Meanwhile, for those who don't know what this is about. Please check the post.  ""The goal of this specific survey is to learn “How complete is our documentation and how can we improve our user docs?”""",1
"oh yes, that's right. Let me check last meeting notes",1
"yes, her deadline was 14th/15th",1
Next topic,1
@zzap and @atachibana will be there leading the table (and most of us will just be jealous),1
"We discussed  last week some strategies on how to attract people to collaborate. I talked about using stats, to show how the Docs are popular. I guess I can go talk to the #meta team and prepare it.",1
"I also started to review our ""Welcome box"" on the DOcs team page and prepare our handbook landpage... all of this is really outdated and make it difficult for new comers. I promise to share something in the next few days",1
"somewhat related to that, we have the beautiful document @zzap shared with a new page about our Badges policy",1
"yes, I added more after people left their comments",1
"We've done a simple large chart, like a thermometer or whatever measure you want, and fill it in with each submission. Fairly low tech, but sense of accomplishment when adding to it and visual to attract people",1
Ok! aaaaand we still have 15 minutes for Open Floor!,1
I’ve mentioned to @zzap the other day that while I was looking at DevHub I submitted some tickets to Trac,1
"A few weeks ago i commented on the lack of rep for the plugin handbook. I'll take it if that works for the collective ""you""",1
Yup you can take lead of the plugin handbook,1
"I just added some data so that people can say ""yay"" or ""nay""",1
"btw, here's test survey
https://milanazzap.survey.fm/untitled-survey (edited)",1
"there are also all form fields (name, address, email, password..) but I don't think we need those",1
we can even choose style,1
"ok, I guess I'm closing the meeting then (@Sunday Ukafia, keep sending what you find, this can be discussed any time, not necessarly during meetings)",1
meeting @Kenshino (Jon)?,1
So today's meeting is going to be quite focused,1
Basically 2 key points,1
Before we get to that and before @atachibana falls asleep,1
It's 12:09am for him,1
Let's cover what he wanted to say,1
Okay next - I do need a note-taker. Can someone volunteer?,1
"Today's main topics
HelpHub (User Docs) Survey
Our presence at WordCamp Asia",1
"@bph you wrote a draft P2 post for the survey, would you like to share it?",1
Dare I take that as direct volunteering to help with the survey efforts?,1
"haha I didn't see that coming but sure, I will be happy to help",1
I'm going to move on to the next topic cause we've only got 20 mins left,1
@zzap @atachibana are going to lead our table there,1
Yes I’ll do,1
@zzap Can I leave this with you to take charge?,1
Okay last thing,1
"I'm going to submit Docs Team Badges this week. If you don't have a badge and should be getting one. Can you please submit your names to either
@atachibana (DevHub, HelpHub Content)
@zzap (HelpHub Dev, Docs Team Handbook)
Theme Review Team reps (Theme Handbook)",1
who's gonna facilitate meeting next week?,1
@nobnob @bph @felipeelia @zzap @atachibana @estelaris @themiked @chetan200891 @passoniate @marcio-zebedeu @WPZA @kafleg @sasiddiqui @jamieschmid @tomjn  anyone of you would like to faciliate next week?,1
Let's put in P2 and see if someone else would volunteer,1
"And I thought she was volunteering... 
 (edited)",1
"We're 22 mins over time so I'm just gonna close the meeting
Thank you all for coming
</meeting>",1
"Our meeting will probably start in a few minutes. In the meantime, I'd appreaciate any thoughts about the comment I've left on the badges P2 post: https://make.wordpress.org/docs/2020/01/08/documentation-team-profile-badges/#comment-39880 Thanks!",1
anyone interested to take notes for today's meeting,1
"If nobody is available, I can do that",1
let's discuss our first agenda today,1
at last meeting regarding Discussion on the Docs team organization in general there was a discussion on Team workflow and badges,1
is there any progress regarding that,1
"Does anyone want to summarise the discussion so far? 
 If we're intending to discuss it in detail of course",1
So we can move on to the next agenda now,1
@bph are we able to get your help on this as well?,1
"Yes, I'd be happy to assist.",1
Sure. Can I ask you to start the P2 post?,1
I can review a draft,1
"Yes, I'll work on the draft:-)",1
Can we move on to the next topic we don't have much time left,1
Regarding Categorizing discovery issue by a proper search system  @estelaris and @atachibana was suppose to work on it together on sub-categorization system any progress regarding it,1
Let's wrap up today's meeting and discuss on leftover agenda on next meeting shall we,1

"(this is an excellent way to help, specially for those coming for the first time)",1
and @audrasjb just volunteered to taking notes?,1
"Just saying hello 
 but yes I can take notes if nobody is available",1
"excellent, thank you!",1
we'll need another volunteer to run our next meeting,1
"27th, Jan",1
"ok, we can get back to this later",1
Our next topic is DevHub migration status,1
"@atachibana, do you want to share some stats?",1
322 of 1069 pages were re-routed from Codex to Code Reference. It is 30.1% of all.,1
"this is one of our ongoing efforts. If anybody wants to help, they can contact you via DM or via this channel, right @atachibana?",1
Our next topic is Discussion on the Docs team organization in general,1
again here: https://make.wordpress.org/docs/2020/01/08/documentation-team-profile-badges/,1
nice! Can we move to our next topic?,1
it is HelpHub,1
last meeting you talked about an ongoing survey,1
actually @atachibana had the stage with the survey topic,1
oki doki then. There is also an item on our agenda about HelpHub Localization,1
Does anyone want to talk about HelpHub or can we move forward?,1
we can move as far as I'm concerned,1
"also folks, as we are at the top of the hour, before we close our meeting, it would be AWESOME to get our next meeting facilitator...",1
"A few follow ups about our last meeting, btw:
https://wordpress.slack.com/archives/C02RP4WU5/p1579524771027500",1
(getting back to follow ups) @nullbyte is welcome to let us know about how is the multisite docs going at any time after the meeting.,1
Just started with them but no real progress yet,1
"my friends, thank you all for coming. I'll call </meeting> but the channel is always open for further discussions. We do need a facilitator for our next meeting, so let us know if you are interested",1
"@channel <meeting type=""docs"">",1
"I'll be facilitating today's meeting 
 Let's get started!",1
1. Attendance. Who is around? Can I ask everyone who is in the meeting to post his/her wp.org nickname? Makes it easier to write the summary and correctly cite people.,1
@channel meeting,1
"Nice! Good to see all of you. While people are still getting in, I will ask about item 2 in the agenda.Do we have a volunteer for Note taking? And to facilitate the next meeting?",1
I can take the Notes @leogermani,1
"Thanks everyone, I guess we can get started",1
First topic we have in the agenda is about our internal organization. We have been trying to organize all our current projects and workflows. Last week @zzap suggested that we added current workflows to this trello card -> https://trello.com/c/GNXYppYS/44-workflows,1
Anyone have an update on that?,1
"(by the way, we do have a trello board now. If anyone wants to have access to it, ask @zzap -> https://trello.com/b/1NtDI3lb/docs-team-handbook )",1
For now we have few workflows defined. We are missing on reporting issue:gutenberg for developers handbookany dev handbookdocs team handbook,1
HelpHub content,1
inline docs (I'll add that one as it is not under docs team any more),1
@atachibana can you add for HelpHub content? (edited),1
"good, I'll just add workflow of reporting issue in trac and link to core handbook for contributing (edited)",1
"Nice, we have people assigned to each workflow now",1
"I'd also like to remind us that we need to refresh our ""Current projects"" page. This is connected with the workflows. We have a card for that too with a draft document as a starting point -> https://trello.com/c/11QKAfmA/45-current-projects-page I guess it would be nice if @atachibana and @Kenshino (Jon) could have a look at it",1
"Ok, let's move to the next point in the meeting. Badges",1
@zzap started the discussion in p2 https://make.wordpress.org/docs/2020/01/08/documentation-team-profile-badges/ . Let's start from there,1
"Next topic is ""Workflows and badges pages"" on the Docs Team handbook. @zzap I've copied it from last week's, not sure if it is any different from what we have already discussed",1
cool. Let's move on to HelpHub,1
ok... I guess maybe we can move to the next topic. If @atachibana comes back and wants to share anything on this we get back to it,1
"Next topic is Helphub Localization
Do we have any updates or questions on this? @felipeelia has anything to share on pt-br?",1
no updates from Serbian team yet,1
"Ok, so @zzap will reach #meta-helphub and @netweb and give us more info on this issue the next meeting",1
In the next topic I brought some specific discussion that happened in the channel the last days. Not sure if it's a good thing to do. Let's try it,1
Do we have a volunteer to make these edits? (I can do it),1
"is this open floor? if yes, I have question:-)",1
sorry I got it we are at 6. of the agenda,1
let's find a volunteer (looking at @nullbyte) (edited),1
"since we are approaching 1 hour, let's move on! (I know this is a hot topic and we can continue discussing it here in the channel)",1
"Last subtopic in this topic is ""Plugins Handbook i18n"" - we are looking for a volunteer to give some love to this page. It's very outdated, from the time when we didnt have translate.wordpress.org yet.",1
I'll do it @leogermani,1
"Finally, item 7 -> DevHub - @atachibana wants to share updates? (I think we should do this in the beginning of the meeting)",1
We redirected 314 of 1069 (29.4 %) of Code Reference’s Functions part. Let’s continue it,1
"We are 10 minutes passed our schedule. Some people have to go to sleep. Some people are hungry and have to lunch. I guess I'll ask @Carike if he have any updates on the new readme file, but he can share it here in the channel after the meeting or whenever there is something new",1
final topic is Open Floor.,1
do we already have the next meeting focus? I'll have to go now,1
well. I guess that's it for today. Thank you everyone for participating and let's keep the conversation running here in the channel. Meetings are too short,1
"<meeting>
Hi! It’s time for weekly polyglots chat (Asia-Pacific time). Who’s here today?",1
"Maybe this will be a very quiet one. Today’s agenda is short:

"Stay tuned for translation project update. As we talked after 5.3 release, we will be pinging GTEs on a p2 post + Slack (once each) before release to remind core translation timing. (edited)",1
"Looks like we are all good on that one.
Let’s move on to the last topic - Achievements & Open Floor",1
"Anything from your side, @Kartik Shukla?",1
"Nothing, just would like to thank all WCAsia organizing team for their hardwork and efforts. Hope we make it more bigger next year",1
Rest any plan for WPTD?,1
Last we did in May’19 I guess,1
"Thanks! Well we had a mini WPTD kind of thing, Virtual Contributor Day “Polyglots Table” last Friday",1
https://make.wordpress.org/polyglots/2020/02/20/join-us-at-virtual-polyglots-contributor-table-tomorrow/,1
"Wow, that’s awesome",1
May be I missed my bad,1
I liked the format. Combination of online co-working and maybe sessions/discussions could be an interesting format for  WPTD?,1
"Local teams participated:
Dzongkha / Spanish (Spain) / Spanish (Venezuela) / Japanese / Malayalam / Marathi / Nepalese / Portuguese (Brazil)
Maybe I’ll do a write-up.
I liked it because it was very easy to organize and can be done often compared to WPTD (FYI for anyone new, that’s WordPress Translation Day)",1
We have a special translation event in three weeks for the meetup volunteers of my city.,1
"I got a new recruit buddy that's already translating plugins and themes, but I want to involved him to the HelpHub articles",1
@nobnob wants to resume the work we started last year about to reunite all the Spanish locale to share the translation milestones,1
We already are sending strings to es_MX for each new plugin or theme we translate,1
"Let us know how it goes.
Okay, I think it’s time for me to finish up the meeting. Thanks for joining, and talk to you soon!",1
Hi all. Welcome to our weekly polyglots <meeting>,1
"ok. You can continue saying ""hi"" as we rush through our agenda. (I'm a bit time-limited today) (edited)",1

(A wordpress.org account could have multiple roles over different locale)
Site language: 54,962% (+0,054%) of WordPress sites are running a translated WordPress site.",1
Next: WordPress 5.4,1
"Some of you may have noted that WordPress 5.4 just reached Beta 2. That means it's time to prepare ourselves for new strings that may come within 1-2 weeks from now. In the meantime, make sure that:
5.3 is fully translated.
Your branch under i18n.svn.wordpress.org has a 5.4 under /branches/ or that your whole branch is empty. More information in https://make.wordpress.org/polyglots/handbook/translating/packaging-localized-wordpress/automated-release-packages/
(edited)",1
"Next is just a quick information that the TV is looking into how to handle various languages in the best way. That topic is already in good hands @Pascal but perhaps more people from here would like to chime in. (For instance, if you'd like content in your language on WordPress TV, then this is a good time to speak up. (under the post I linked in the agenda.) (edited)",1
"soft string freeze is planned for BETA 3
At 25 Feb, see https://make.wordpress.org/core/5-4/
Hard freeze at 3 Mar, Release date - 31 Mar (edited)",1
hopefully new Gutenberg translations will be merged into core again,1
"And, thanks to @sergey, localized versions and langpacks will be built as part of main release process.",1
"Next: As you may have heard/seen: WP Asia was cancelled this year. It's contributor day was supposed to happen Friday, the day after tomorrow. Perhaps @nao can add a couple of words here?",1
"On this Friday, February 21st, I plan on being around 3-10 UTC (10-17 Bangkok time) in this channel, and I’ll work on Polyglots tasks during the time. Anyone is free to join working along, asking questions, or sharing your tips, etc.",1
"If enough people wants to hang out on Zoom, happy to host it too.
Here’s the time slot:
https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?iso=20200221T10&p1=28&ah=7 (edited)",1
Great. Yeah. Let's help @nao to get a fruitful contributor day. That would ease that weird feeling of having a huge conference cancelled with such short notice.,1
And now we've reached the last topic: Achievements/open floor. I'm going to rest my keyboard a minute and listen to you!,1
Any recent contributor days?,1
"I can mention from the polyglots blog that we may see a locale revival soon. 
 Check out the comments under https://make.wordpress.org/polyglots/2020/02/18/hi-68/ (edited)",1
"ok. It seems relatively quiet here now. So I'll do </meeting>
But, this channel is still ours to use 24/7. If you've got any questions or relevant asks, feel free to write here at any time. Since we're a global community, there are almost always peers around to help you if you get stuck.",1
@channel Hi Polyglots. It's time for our weekly chat. Welcome!,1

Hmm. I don't believe that 100% of all WordPress installs are running translated versions of our platform. @Pascal You may want to check what happened there,1
No more English installs,1
"Site language: 100,000%
Awesome work by the polyglots team. I am proud to be a part of.",1
"Besides that, I've got one piece of news: If you get questions about where developers could look for paid translations, then there is now a new ""translation"" (still empty, though) category in jobs.wordpress.net that you can recommend: https://jobs.wordpress.net/job_category/translation/ (and you may want to keep an eye on this section if you're open for work...)",1
"And that brings us quickly to Open floor
Any questions, achievements or other related things you want to share?",1
We have WordCamp Asia coming up in few days,1
"It's quiet here now. So let's close the weekly chat. But our channel is here all the time. Whenever you have a question to your fellow Polyglots, never hesitate to raise it here.

Not everyone has found the page where they can enter this information. https://profiles.wordpress.org/me/profile/edit/group/5/,1

Our next item is Spanish Slack,1
During the last meeting we talked about the creation of a new channel here on this slack. The idea's been discussed in a P2 post but Ali already created a new instance of Slack for Spanish speakers,1
"The URL is spanishpolyglots.slack.com
and it is possible to join using your chat.wordpress.org ID, i.e., the same email alias created to join this instance (edited)",1
"Ok, can we go to the next topic?",1
Nice. Let's briefly Follow up of previous meeting topics,1
"Ok, I've put a reminder in the agenda pointing to @Jesús Amieiro’s tool: https://make.wordpress.org/polyglots/2019/10/30/wp-polyglots-facilitator/",1
Totally worth reading,1
"I've added a link in our handbook, too.",1
"And to close this topic we have ""Mentoring circles for GTEs"". I guess we didn't have any movement on this too, unless some conversation was made in the Spanish slack that I'm not aware about",1
"Nice, can we go to the next topic?",1
I hard from some folks saying they prefer a new post for notes. Please feel free to create a post.,1
(That way they can find it rather than a comment. We can combine Asia + Americas mtg note in a one post too),1
"oh, that would be great (combining them)",1
"Ok, so, our last topic is HelpHub i18n",1
We had the content import some locales were waiting for and now it is possible to start translating helphub articles,1

"Awesome, glad to hear it @chetan200891! I'll be freeing up some more time to work on the theme ahead of WordCamp US as well.",1

Planning on working on it over the weekend as I have some time available,1
"We had another issue filed for missing images on the ""Local Install"" lesson plan https://github.com/wptrainingteam/local-install/issues/10",1
"We had this issue on other lesson plans too, but we replaced the images.",1
"I suspect there are many lessons with this issue, the images were previously hosted on make.wordpress.org/training, and are no longer there.",1
"Thanks for that context, yeah that's a remnant of the team's migration to GitHub for lessons",1
Anyone else with updates on lesson plans?,1
"OK, open discussion time. As I mentioned I'll be at a conference next week and I'll miss the meeting. I believe Julie will be back by then, though",1

"yes. first, I think we should update our handbook",3
<abbr>OK</abbr>,3
I’ll ask the Docs team to add this item to Monday’s Doc team meeting agenda,3
I would only suggest not to set too many goals: I think we also have to reserve some time to follow Gutenberg evolution.,3
looks great to me,3
"well, we’ll see who is interested in what",3
"For now, we should probably move on: targeting table views & alternate color schemes is a good start. Howdy menu might also be workable; it should be a fairly small change, relatively speaking.",3
perfect,3
"I haven't delved into it enough yet to think about that, honestly. I'll have to read through the original pull request and think about it.",3
"The root cause of the issue, with “Top toolbar” on is that the block toolbar is nested within the header toolbar.",3
"Yes, either the toolbar should be moved down, or the publish buttons need to visually move.",3
"Visually, it’s:
edit-post-header__toolbar          edit-post-header__settings
edit-post-header-toolbar__block-toolbar
(edited)",3
"I’d argue that if edit-post-header-toolbar__block-toolbar  needs to be last, you should move it outside of edit-post-header__toolbar  instead of swapping the elements DOM order and then change the visual order with CSS.",3
"Move things in the source, not via CSS.",3
"However, we’re in Beta 3 so….",3
Yes it will be reverted,3
Are the findings in that spreadsheet going to be moved to issues in GH?,3
I think that’s a great next step. Would you prefer if we did that @mapk? I can take care of that,3
That would be super helpful!,3
If we can have them in issues we can then all collaborate easier.,3
"I asked to discuss this ticket because it’s an opportunity to think at ways to improve, I don’t know how to call it, the “Howdy” fly-out in the WordPress admin.",3
"I do that all the time, too.",3
"So in the Gutenberg context, the Gutenberg “Publish” button is very close to the “Howdy” fly-out",3
Any non-well controlled mouse movement triggers the “Howdy” fly-out,3
"that’s the case on all other admin pages as well, where the “Help” and “Screen Options” buttons are right there, at the top right",3
There’s a small JS utility in place (hoverintent.js) that tries to mitigate the problem for all the top toolbar items,3
It appears that’s not sufficient to avoid unintended triggering of the “Howdy” fly-out,3
I'd love it if we made a lot more use of the link + disclosure model and got rid of a lot of hover actions.,3
"That said, it’s an opportunity to look also at other potential a11y improvements for the “Howdy” fly-out. (edited)",3
"I’m always triggering the Dashboard flyout when trying to add a block, so there’s that issue on the other side of the screen too",3
"Ok so two items 

triggering of all the top toolbar items
audit of the content specific to the “Howdy” fly-out",3
"Regarding the second item, there are redundant links, for example",3
We also need to consider that some plugins add stuff to the “Howdy” fly-out,3
Was thinking that a collaborative audit of the “Howdy” fly-out would be great.,3
I think that I can honestly state that I have never used the Howdy fly-out intentionally; only by accident.,3
"The native content of it is, in my opinion, of very limited value.",3
Could we eliminate it unless a plug-in has added content?,3
I couldn’t even tell you what’s in the Howdy flyout,3
Could a delay help?,3
"Links to your profile page, that repeats what’s in the admin menu already",3
"If we determine that the content is necessary, I'd be open to considering a delay; but if the content of the flyout is not necessary, I think we should start by exploring its elimination.",3
@Dani Hooven a delay is what hoverintent.js basically does,3
"Like, user would have to hold their mouse over for x amount of time before the flyout appeared. That way if you're moving and clicking quickly, the subitems wouldn't pop out.",3
"That is what hoverintent.js does. But if we lengthen the delay period, it runs the risk that the user will conclude that there is no hover effect. However, I still think that the starting consideration should be whether the information disclosed is necessary or useful. The default content consists of two links to the user's profile (which is also the visible link in the adminbar) and a log out link. The log out link is important, but the a11y team has long argued that this is not a good location for it.",3
Move logout to profile page?,3
"Now this new Gutenberg implementation goes in the opposit direction, basically ignoring all the prior work that was done.",3
"Just thinking “out loud” here, but it seems this is going backwards instead of forward? What are the reasons these changes are being introduced? What am I missing?",3
That’s why we’re discussing this...,3
I mean…it seems like we’re all in agreement here. What is the next step? Do we all comment on the blog post and GitHub issue?,3
There must be a reason that this is being changed? I am trying to understand the problem that someone is trying to solve with this approach?,3
"One of the reasons is the general development process that I’d call “not ideal”, to be fair.",3
I think the accessibility team should deal with issue 1 that joe mention; issue 2 for me seems like the design team to enforce,3
There is a reason to change the button specs in Gutenberg - but there is not a good reason to change them to something other than the previously published core design specs for buttons.,3
so whats our next steps?,3
"Additional question (if we want to consider WCAG 2.1, but WordPress goes only for 2.0): since buttons are, by their nature, interactive elements, their target size should be at least 44 px × 44 px, or am I wrong?",3
"Worth also noting the Gutenberg team announced the button component change yesterday on a post published on Make:
https://make.wordpress.org/core/2020/02/13/an-updated-button-component-in-wordpress-5-4/",3
I’d like to hear something from the Gutenberg team to explain why they can’t use the existing specs. They’ve agreed to fix the accessibility problem; but why have they ignored other existing design choices?,3
"@ryokuhi yes, I understand 44 px x 44 px is the preferred target size these days.",3
@ryokuhi that would be preferable though 44x44 is AAA level. WordPress aims for AA level.,3
@joedolson How do we go about asking that and getting an answer?,3
"@afercia Ooops, my fault...",3
"Hey 
 Is the 44px the largest concern there?",3
Nope. The main one is the fixed height.,3
And ignoring prior design decisions.,3
Yeah fixed heights and widths are... anti-web-medium patterns,3
"And ignoring prior design decisions.
Can you be more specific, Joe?",3
"The main one is the fixed height.
I can see this being a big concern. Makes sense.",3
https://make.wordpress.org/design/2019/10/31/proposal-a-consistent-spacing-system-for-wordpress/,3
"I know @afercia already left some feedback, would anyone else be up for summarizing our team feedback and addint it to the issue and/or the Make post?",3
"More specific:
October 18, 2019
WordPress 5.3 dev notes:
https://make.wordpress.org/core/2019/10/18/noteworthy-admin-css-changes-in-wordpress-5-3/
> In general, plugin authors and WordPress developers are encouraged to:
> - remove any fixed heights: 
 -->flexible heights are the WordPress recommended standard<-- 
 (and one of the main goals of the Admin CSS changes).
> - remove any custom top and bottom padding values.
> - remove any custom line-height values.
> - update their CSS code to override new focus/hover buttons colors if they use custom colors on this type of element. (edited)",3
"Yes, seems like good discussion on the merged PR. I'm totally in favor of moving to flexible heights (not fixed).",3
Maybe we should all go comment - is the post or the GitHub issue better?,3
"I’d encourage to review the Gutenberg new implementation soon. Then, the Make post should be amended.",3
@joedolson Are you aware if that proposal has been fully adopted? I need to read through it again.,3
"Also, I’m looking into a way that we could be notified when the label for Needs Accessibility Feedback is assigned to a GitHub issue.",3
@nataliemac I think the GH issue would be ideal. But maybe if more preferably would be to create a new issue relating to the merged PR that desires a flexible height on all buttons.,3
Ah! @nataliemac there are definitely Slack integrations that can help with that.,3
The dev note Andrea posted recommends it; I’m not sure any decisions in WordPress dev are ever fully adopted.,3
I hear ya... I'm just trying to define which specific design decisions were being ignored.,3
"Right now, my understanding is that the two main issues are the fixed height, and the size of the buttons.",3
"Quoting from the Gutenberg PR:
 Once this PR lands, we should follow-up with a Core ticket for consistency across all WP-Admin.
Please, no",3
I hear ya!,3
Also see https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/18244,3
"I've got to step away again, but I really appreciate bringing things like this to light. It's super helpful. If there isn't one already, would this team mind creating an issue in GH regarding the fixed heights?",3
"We’ll do, thanks @mapk",3
"Also posted on Make (on October 31, 2019):
https://make.wordpress.org/design/2019/10/31/proposal-a-consistent-spacing-system-for-wordpress/ (edited)",3
"@joedolson thanks for those links. However, it is difficult for me to accept ""proposals"" and ""experiments"" as agreed upon design decisions. They will definitely help me track down conversations though! I appreciate that.",3
"Note that as far as I know, WordPress has no method of defining or tracking decisions; the only difference, as far as I can tell, is whether something has been committed.",3
"I don’t know, @mapk from the post on Make, it seems like the button change is planned for 5.4 and moving ahead.",3
"As I see it’s two different cases:
flexible heights are implemented and a new recommended standard in WordPress
buttons size: still a proposal, true. Let’s say that at the very least there’s a huge lack of coordination within teams
(edited)",3
This doesn’t help other teams to make well informed decisions.,3
"My issue is really that there is a proposal, and now there’s suddenly a second, different proposal, but no communication between the two proposals to try and rectify the differences.",3
"This process should be improved 
 What can we do to improve it?",3
"At the moment, we are in Beta: if we consider the implementation of the button as a regression, we can ask to revert it.",3
"Re: the new size: I also mentioned on the GitHub PR that 36 pixels is too much in the context of the WordPress admin. Often, form controls are horizontally aligned. That means _all_ form controls would need the new height including input fields, selects, etc.  That would be a huge change and should have been tested in the context of the WordPress admin before introducing it in Gutenberg as “done”.",3
"It may help but I think the fundamental problem is this team doesn’t have the bandwidth to follow Gutenberg development, which is very fast.",3
"I think in this specific case the problem isn’t the Accessibility team is not able to follow. Instead, it’s about how some decisions are made with a clear lack of information and probably with a too large level of autonomy.",3
"Would have to try it. But yes, the pace of dev in Gutenberg is beyond what I can track, for sure.",3
"Also, I think that the problem is really that, while there are a lot of full time contributors to the design team, there are very few full time contributors to the accessibility team: this means that, as much as we do (and maybe I'm not doing enough in the first place), we will never be able to keep up.",3
"In the past, I stressed a few times that any change in Gutenberg that affects the rest of WordPress  should be discussed on Trac for visibility to a larger audience.",3
@nrqsnchz the bug scrubs tend to switch between Gutenberg and core depending on current focus. Can’t usually track both.,3
"The GitHub repo isn’t good for that, as the project there is followed by a smaller group",3
"Ok, let’s all put some further thought on this topic, and we’ll get back to it next week, I’ll make sure it’s added to next week’s agenda. Hopefully we’ll gather some ideas and suggestions on how to go about it.",3
Is that OK?,3
"@ryokuhi to clarify, how should someone enter the tab’s content?",3
Are the help tabs set up with ARIA tabs? I haven’t nt looked at that for a long time.,3
@joedolson nope,3
"@nrqsnchz I would say either by pressing ""Enter"" (""Return"") or ""Space"".",3
"Regardless of personal preferences, either model is a legitimate and understood system. As an isolated usage, a change from existing use, and unnecessary use of ARIa, I think we should not make this change at this time.",3
I’m not sure providing a non-expected interaction would be ideal @ryokuhi,3
Am I correct in saying we don’t have an agreement here?,3
The options are: use ARIA tabs with the expected interaction or don’t use,3
"can you clarify what you mean by “expected interaction”, @afercia?",3
@nrqsnchz the one described in the ARIA Authoring Practices,3
"If they are ARIa tabs, they should work by using arrow keys and tab to enter the panel. If they are not ARia tabs, they can work in other ways.",3
"Ok, I will try to summarize our feedback and I’ll add it to the issue",3
Yup but the “other ways” would be totally unexpected and not discoverable.,3
Are you arguing that we should change them? Because they are currently not ARIA tabs.,3
Not to mention there’s the risk to have UIs that look the same but behave differently…,3
They’re not but they don’t implement any custom interaction to move into the content.,3
"Ok. To me, that is included in “work in other ways”.",3
E.g. “normal flow”,3
"They’re just button, so it is expected they’re interactive. On press, they switch the content. Then, users have to press Tab and that’s the native interaction.",3
"Have y’all seen these two PRs?
https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/19235
https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/19726
They are recent. I’ve tested them and in my humble opinion navigation to and from the sidebar has been improved a lot.",3
"One of the goals, maybe the goal, to have shared meetings with design folks was to try to address these broader issues.",3
I have to say we didn’t make any spectacular progress in 10 months. (edited),3
Well should we discuss the current accessibility status of the Gutenberg sidebar or its future status?,3
"I'd argue that the sidebar is appreciably improved, but still clumsy. When in edit mode,  the sidebar is the next tab stop when exiting the active block - I don't think this used to be the case. However, the very fact that the sidebar is a group of settings that are separated from the primary content of the block is still very awkward - all of the navigation back and forth between block and settings is something that is making an existing problem workable.",3
"Let's start with the current status, in brief, then move on.",3
"In my opinion, the current status is functional, but only thanks to a variety of tools that assist users in moving between disparate regions that should be closer together, such as the block & sidebar - which should really be all one object.",3
"which should really be all one object.
That",3
Functional as in “can be operated” but actually not that easy to operate? @joedolson,3
"I should say, the block settings tab of the sidebar & the block should be one object - the sidebar also contains the document settings, and those should be separate.",3
"Yes - functional as in can be operated. And, to be fair, considerably easier to use than it was a year ago - I don't want to make the claim that there has been no progress; but it's all been towards making the existing model work, rather than in changing the model.",3
"I remember that a few alternatives where explored on this issue https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/13663, could we provide additional suggestion to the design team? (edited)",3
Yep I’d like to clarify that when I said “there’s just one more button now that allows to “jump” to the sidebar.” I meant after the introduction of Navigation / Edit mode there was no specific improvement other than that new button. Te underlying issue stays: controls that should be grouped are separated instead.,3
Those alternatives still embrace the idea that the block settings are separate from the block.,3
"Question: What are the plans for the Sidebar when it comes to Full Site Editing on the front end?
There will be a sidebar also on the front end? (edited)",3
No idea; I haven't seen anything about that.,3
Any designer who can offer some feedback on Sidebar and Full Site Editing?,3
The essential problem is that the block settings are not part of the block. Having them part of the block would solve a lot of accessibility problems.,3
"Yes, it is better now than it used to be, within the paradigm of accepting that the block settings are separate.",3
"I’d argue it would solve problems also for users with no specific accessibility needs 
  I saw in the testing sessions videos many users focusing on the ccntral part of the editor (the content) visually skipping anything that lives in the Sidebar.",3
"Here’s the project board for Full Site Editing https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/projects/35
And yes, the sidebar is a pattern that is used in FSE",3
"So the question for us: are we going to accept the sidebar as it is, and work within that framework, or are we going to continue to fight for moving those settings into the block context?",3
I love how the ‘needs a11y feedback’ column is blank.,3
"To be fair, I’m not sure why we’re still using sidebars to start with 
 The history of WordPress proved they’re always problematic. For the ones who followed the project in the last years, sidebars are well known to create more problems than what they solve. This applies to the media modal, the Customizer, etc. (edited)",3
"I think we should keep trying to change it, but we have to figure out how to get someone to listen. We can keep saying it, but nobody’s paying any attention.",3
It is amazing how many of the accessibility problems in WordPress come from moving back and forth between sidebars and context...,3
"I think A lot of people are paying attention. That previous issue I shared has a lot of explorations, and even prototypes from folks on the design team. A lot of effort went into that.
I believe it’s not a matter if they are listening, because we are (I contribute on the design team as well). It’s a matter that, in addition to point something is broken. we need to work with them to find solutions.",3
"It's circular design thinking that causes this: struggling to design something that accommodates these controls in context, so let's find some available space for controls, this (desktop) screen is wider than it needs to be for text editing, hey look! There's empty space at the side! Then, of course, we go modal or linearize the content and everything falls apart.",3
"Regardless, what we need to do is decide what we will promote for this. Do we have a agreed-on concept of what we would like this to be? How will it work? Can we mock it up?",3
"I, for one, don't think visually at all; so for me the problem is that I can easily visualize how I want it to work from a screen reader & keyboard standpoint, but then I blank out on visual appearance - because that's not really how I conceptualize interfaces.",3
"I think that we're in general agreement - at least Andrea and I are, from this conversation - that the block settings should be part of the block. They don't all need to be visible all the time; but the code structure should have all block settings within a single context. That's the change I believe that Andrea and I both want to see. (Tell me if you disagree, Andrea.)",3
I don't really give a damn what it looks like.,3
I agree too,3
Joe: you have my vote.,3
how can we materialize this agreement?,3
Suggest / encourage the design team to explore settings within the block and also user-test it?,3
"which is what this team has been doing for months, and we haven’t gotten to where we want. (edited)",3
"how can we move the needle more? I mentioned that perhaps we can suggest solutions. Do y’all think we could try this? I understand not everyone on this team is visual, but some of  us are. We can work together and try?",3
"I don't really know. I feel like the design team keeps coming back to visual design issues; but I think this is a structural issue, first. Fix the structure, then all of the concerns about whether content is being managed in the sidebar go away.",3
We don’t really have a UX team,3
I think that should be a part of the proposal; but it may be stronger combined with a couple of possible visuals.,3
I agree with @ryokuhi: we should encourage the design team to adopt something similar to a progressive enhancement approach,3
@ryokuhi agreed. I think that would be a great step 1.,3
I think we need a three part proposal: text description of the problem; description of the structural changes required to make this happen; and visual proposals showing possible design concepts.,3
"@ryokuhi we can, but many persons in the Design team are more “visual” and I guess they would struggle a bit to get that level of abstraction.",3
and then move to what Joe proposes,3
Structure (required) + Visual (proposal) together may work,3
(I think you've already written a lot of that in GH issues; just need helping find them and assembling them into a proposal...),3
"Maybe after Beta I can try to find some time @joedolson Right now, I’m a bit busy abd very short on time",3
I don't expect this to happen this week!,3
"Timing-wise, I'd think of this as a WP 5.5 targeted concern, which gives us some time.",3
"It's also a major change, so it gives us a lot less time than we might imagine we have...",3
"First item:
Incorrect cursor used on buttons: this Trac ticket needs a decision from the accessibility team.
https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/47171",3
"This is one of those things that's incorrect all over the internet, and probably comes from the general conflation of button and link behavior. I think it's a good idea for us to try to be consistent, although it will probably be offputting and confusing for some users, at first.",3
"In a nutshell: The native browsers cursor on buttons and labels is the default one.
WordPress overrides the browsers default by using the pointer cursor which, ideally, should be reserved for links.",3
I vote for default cursor on buttons and save pointer for links.,3
"So is this just in the WP admin, or applies to the button block also?",3
In which case we also need to have some clarity between behaviors & elements. Should an anchor element that performs a button function have the default cursor?,3
"@joyously Confusingly, I believe the button block is most often used to insert a link that looks like a button",3
"The button block outputs a link, an <a>  element where the pointer cursor is appropriate.",3
"Also, the cursor style for the button block should be controlled by the theme.",3
"Regardless, we have to address several cases: button elements that operate as buttons, button elements that operate as links, anchors that operate as buttons, and anchors that operate as links. The first and last are unambiguous; but the other two cases we'll have to make decisions about.",3
Maybe the solution to those cases is to use the correct elements for their purpose,3
"Ideally, change the buttons that are actually links to be just links?",3
"The WP Campus report specifically says that the ""controls that navigate users to new pages/views should have cursor set to pointer"", so if we follow those guidelines, then it's the behavior that's dominant for this.",3
"This is one of those things that’s incorrect all over the internet,
Playing devil’s advocate: Does it actually harm the users experience? (edited)",3
"This is one of those ""maybe"" cases - it is possible that it could confuse a user. However, it's conflated so significantly globally, that I'd argue it could also confuse a user for a button not to have the pointer cursor. It's just that one of those cases is correct and the other is not.",3
Not all links are blue and underlined either.,3
"There’s no requirement that links be blue, but they should be underlined.",3
"On the whole, I don't think this is a super important issue; I'd prioritize ensuring that elements are used appropriately, first. But it's also a pretty easy fix, once we decide exactly what should change.",3
"Let's try to stay focused on the issue, thanks!",3
"Question (as always, I ask questions): would changing the pointers so that they match their suggested usage be detrimental for someone?",3
"I think that the consequence might be some small hesitation because a user expected a pointer cursor, and momentarily hesitated before taking their action. That's probably about it.",3
Test page: https://codepen.io/afercia/full/EzjXMo,3
"I think we should make the change. The only reason the pointer cursor would normally be necessary is if we're in a situation where the button has no discernible :hover state, as in that case the pointer cursor is the only visual indicator that the button is an active element.",3
"Apart from pointer changes, are there other ways to suggest to the user that the element allows interaction (for example: changing hover background color)?",3
All kinds of style changes can be made on focus/hover to communicate affordance. (edited),3
"As per specs reference, it’s stated in the CSS specs:
The W3C spec (CSS 2.2) https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS22/ui.html#cursor-props
pointer: The cursor is a pointer that indicates a link.
Same for CSS3 UI: https://www.w3.org/TR/css-ui-3/#cursor
The rationale is that pointer should be reserved for links, to help users differentiate UI controls that trigger navigation from buttons and the like. Granted, in WordPress you never know whether what are you going to click is a button or a link For historical reasons, sometimes links are styled as buttons, and buttons are styled as links. Ideally, this shouldn't happen. Links should be clearly identified as links. Buttons should be identified as buttons.
(edited)",3
"If we agree, then we have to decide whether we're going to just change all button elements, period, or only change button elements if they don't move the user to a new location or change the view.",3
"Just buttons that actually behave like buttons, I think.",3
"A button is a button, and an anchor is an anchor: I would go with the standard.",3
"The question is whether we're going to take the remediation advice in the WP Campus issue or choose a different solution, essentially.",3
"Well, I think revisiting where buttons/links are used is another issue that should be addressed.",3
"I'm inclined to switch all button elements to use the default pointer, then, as @nataliemac suggests, address any problematic buttons as a separate issue.",3
There's an issue for that already in trac from the last time we looked at those.,3
"Ok, I can get on board with that approach.",3
"I’d tend to think our recommendation as accessibility team should be to just stick to the standards.
That said, I guess we should get some consensus from design and I’m not sure this can be done for 5.4.",3
"If design agrees, this is a pretty simple CSS change - I think it should be doable.",3
"Yep, my concern is about getting consensus in time",3
"I'd also go for the standard: but I would remove cursor properties, instead of changing them to default (if that might be equally good). (edited)",3
"Well, let's go for it. If it doesn't make it, that's fine; but I don't see any reason not to go for it.",3
I think the result is likely the same,3
Less code = more speed.,3
"Per comments on the thread, by the way, the last call from design was ""it's accessibility's call""",3
"I’d add that if there’s really a usability issue with buttons and labels, it would be up to browser vendors and the W3C to fix it.",3
Shortly: don’t mess with browser defaults.,3
I would be perfectly happy if browsers decided to abruptly change the button default cursor to something else; I don't think we need to make that happen.,3
Amen.,3
"It's accessibility call, but the design team suggestions were different from ours, I would ping them just for information.",3
"Not sure I agree; looks disabled to me. I'm fine leaving this to design to address, though.",3
"Just noting WP buttons worked this way since forever. That’s not to say they can’t be improved. Nothing new, though.",3
Maybe someone would expect it to be gray if it’s disabled? I think it looks disabled the way it is as well.,3
"I'm fine commenting for accessibility that we don't have any issues with making design changes to the disabled button look, but that we don't see an accessibility problem here.",3
"Considering that disabled controls don’t have contrast requirements, I’d say it’s a design team call.",3
"For discussion today, we can ignore my last comment on that issue. Even if that method is not only possible but better, it's not going to be ready within 2 weeks.",3
My point on this issue is that this team official position is to avoid placing controls in the Gutenberg sidebar as much as possible.,3
That comment ties in with something we've wanted for a long time - the ability to have a relationship between videos and their caption files...,3
This was a concern since the very early accessibility reviews of Gutenbreg and also highlighted in this team Make post on end 2018l,3
"Now, in the current media views interface, the main source file and the alternate sources are displayed all together in the same UI.",3
The proposal on the issue is to place the alternate sources in the sidebar.,3
So the change would be from a unified UI to a split one.,3
I’m not sure this is an accessibility improvement,3
"Is there a mockup of what's currently proposed? I assume it's not @mapk's comment from 27 Dec., but that's the last one I'm seeing.",3
"Most of all: the official position of this team is that the Gutenberg sidebar is one of the broader, still in-need-to-be-solved, issues in Gutenberg.",3
"In all tests I made with users at the Accessibility table during WordCamps, moving for the editor to the sidebar using only the keyboard is very complicated, even for sighted users. I wouldn't add anything there. (edited)",3
"I think that this issue is not what we're discussing - it's just the general question of whether we still hold to our stance that the Gutenberg sidebar is an unsolved issue such that we need to avoid adding controls to it. Is that accurate, @afercia?",3
"Yup, this specific issue is obviously depending on our stance on the sidebar.",3
"To my knowledge, the only change is that there’s now one more button to “jump” to the sidebar.",3
"OK. I think that we should probably give more time to that discussion, practically speaking. I'd need to refresh my memory on how the sidebar works now.",3
Are you OK with tabling this question to have a more broad-ranging conversation next week?,3
"Probably; but mostly I need to work on converting these notes into something that could be reasonably posted as GitHub issues. Anybody have an opinion whether I should post a unique issue for each block, an issue for each type of issue described, or one single issue listing everything?",3
(I feel like that last option is not a good one...),3
"If we create a unique issue for each block, I think that the general framework of the proposed changes might be less clear.",3
"Question - who would be the audience for the GitHub issues? If it is those who will need to make changes, an issue for each block would seem to make more sense?",3
"That was also my concern.  Easier to resolve, however, possibly.",3
"Maybe one issue per issue, and then whoever gets to work on it will decide if they split it into multiple sub issues or not? (edited)",3
"It's also possible that these issues would be best resolved as a group, anyway; a single common change through several blocks might be best done as a single commit.",3
I'll go with that. One issue for each type of concern.,3
"Maybe these issues can be grouped in a single project: this way, it would be easier to understand them as a whole. (edited)",3
"I wonder if we can do something coordinated, like what Joe did for the block focus.
Does anyone have any thoughts?",3
Somebody who isn't me should definitely coordinate that.,3
totally agree,3
"I’m happy to coordinate things, just want to hear what folks think",3
"It's a very different type of project - the issue logging will be more complicated than block focus was, since it's not a single pattern we're checking behavior of.",3
"I think the point of doing logging outside of GitHub is so that we can take a look at our concerns as a group; log all the issues that we see, discuss them and agree on them, then transition into GitHub issues - it's a good way to form an overview of concerns & reaching agreement before we create issues. That said, a lot of what we need here is a means to log and track a variety of related but disparate issues.",3
So we need to figure out a good method to do that - that isn't directly in the Gutenberg GitHub repo. I'm not sure we need to be overly formal about it - maybe a combination of Google Docs & Sheets is sufficient. Thoughts?,3
"yep, I agree with what you said. We can use google docs for our initial testing and observations and then move whatever we think needs to be moved to github issues",3
Thoughts on offering it prior to WC Atlanta (April 17th) or after? (edited),3
"Hmm, it could easily be a series that spans before and after",3
"I think that if you do it before, it could help get some new fresh topics/events on the schedule. So once the WordCamp is over, you'll probably have a lot more interested new meetup members, and events already planned to keep the momentum going",3
"and if you keep up with it, new organizers for the next WordCamp too!",3
Excellent suggestions! I will get something scheduled in March to kick it off.,3
Would we want these to be the same or different mentors than the amazing ones who do the main camps?,3
Different.,3
"Mentors need to have first hand experience of what they’re mentoring on. Most WordCamp organizers, myself included, haven’t organized a KidsCamp.",3
We could change that @camikaos,3
"Hello, sorry I was not able to get out of another WP meeting in time to ask this in your chat today. A question from the marketing team. 
Is there any further promotion planned we can help you with or link to for the Meetup survey. Mike Reid highlighted it to the marketing team at this week’s meeting as he received it as a Meetup organizer. Good luck with the survey, and do let us know if we can help.
https://wordpressdotorg.survey.fm/2019-annual-meetup-program-survey",3
"There have been a few discussions to date around how we can improve annual surveys, and we’ve come to some conclusions, shared on that post. Please take some time to review and weigh in!",3
"great proposal, would really love to see those happen. Hopefully the changes will increase amount of persons responding.",3
yeah - the number of responses there have been diminshing each year,3
"Agreed, it would be fantastic and super helpful to get more response on that survey!",3
The next post is a request for feedback on Speaker Feedback Tool Scope: https://make.wordpress.org/community/2020/01/14/feedback-request-speaker-feedback-tool-scope/,3
"The first is a Proposal for an official WordCamp app for iOS, watchOS and tvOS. You can find more info on that here: https://make.wordpress.org/community/2020/01/10/proposal-for-an-official-wordcamp-app-for-ios-watchos-and-tvos/",3
"to be honest, not sure if we need an official app. That will needs someone actively to maintain it…",3
"Maintenance is a very good question, and I think the proposal suggests that the Mobile team do that",3
"I think the features are very limited - just offering whats available in central website.
Platform is biased for iOS users only",3
"im not sold on the idea in general, regardless of how good the app is",3
i dont know if an app is really something that we need or something that would be particularly useful,3
"As we found out, our handbook needs to be updated. We already started working on the worflows for ""everything"" we do, so we can better document it and people can easily find out how to collaborate",3
"I gave it a look on how people navigate through our handbook and saw that our ""Welcome box"" is really outdated and have consufing links...",3
"I started a proposal to change that, and also create a home page for our handbook, that has an short overview of what we do and then will link to more detailed pages for each project",3
"Regarding the welcome box, The initial phrase is tricky. It used to say that we were responsible for everything related to Docs, but we now share it with other teams... I made a suggestion on how to write that, but definetely needs some attention",3
"and also the Home page... I tried to propose something really simple, that gives an overview. I tried to think of something that would have helped me when I first came to the team",3
"(about this, for example, I introduce the DevHub and HelpHub names, because this is something we use internally, but that do not show up anywhere in the interface for visitors... so its very confusing - then I favored using developer.wordpress.org and wordpress.org/support instead",3
"So for now, just wanted to ask for feedback/help on those contents",3
I can take a look at that this week @leogermani,3
"But also, everyone should",3
This is just an addition to Sunday's comments earlier,3
"When we migrated content, we had a lot of volunteers, I noticed references to some supporting WordPress.com help docs that shouldn't have been there",3
"And something came up last week about external links and the policy...and although they don't really violate the policy, some of them probably are outdated",3
"Point is, some of that content probably still needs to be revisited for updates and such",3
@leogermani Create a meta ticket and Ill chime in there,3
@tomf Do you have a list of those pages that contain outdated / irrelevant WordPress.com links?,3
"@Kenshino (Jon) Not really, but I noticed in the process, we weren't so much focused on accuracy of the content at that point, but just getting it moved",3
"Yes, the problems I've seen out on the net elsewhere being reported I don't think are necessarily related to accuracy per say, but reactive",3
"Yet, we did manage to classify many and some people committed to continue helping until we are done",3
"I think our comments were not reactive, but more on the ""how do we help update that article?"" kind of way",3
Do we have the notes of your discussion somewhere? ^,3
"@estelaris With these updates being made, is it worth continuing with the help happy translations? (edited)",3
@Kenshino (Jon) what about the documents that need a better title? Should I give a list of those to @tomf?,3
"I have it hidden in the shadows 
 shall I throw it onto GitHub or something?",3
please do,3
noted,3
"yes, please share it.",3
We definelty need some action to speed this migration up and finish it,3
"with that out of hte way, this survey seems to be asking some questions we can find out without theuser tellingus",3
"for example, how they found us. Thats just stats analysis",3
"Is the goal for the survey from a user view (using the product and finding documentation) or developer view (creating plugins, extending) or both?",3
what device they use...same,3
"the question being asked is ""How complete is our documentation and how can we improve our user docs?""",3
@themiked agree. We talked about looking at stats last week.,3
yep I remember,3
"""How complete is our documentation"" is not an answerable question",3
esp not for end users,3
"I guess we should leave this feedback in the p2 post, so it's all in one place. I'd love to hear from @bph what is a good road map for the survey, with WC Asia in mind.
Feedback period - date
First draft of the form - date
Feedback on the form - date
Release date- date",3
"Also, if anyone is willing to help her on that, please raise your hands in the p2 post. It's a lot of work",3
I think we already set deadline because she's going to holiday soon (edited),3
"Please add your comments by February 12th, and we will be able to prepare the survey in time for launch at WordCamp Asia, February 21st.",3
"@themiked asking in an open ended form like that won't get the answer we want, but it is answerable. If a user is trying to do something, are they getting the answer from WP or elsewhere? (edited)",3
"Who can answer whether we have access to CrowdSignal? If not, iss Google forms an option?",3
why CrowdSignal? was it decided on previous meetings?,3
"CrowdSignal is former Pollbuddy... no decision, but it's the one that might stick around and is not on rented land...",3
as it's owned by Automattic.,3
"oki doki, I think we'll have more info from @Kenshino (Jon)",3
"Does someone want to review whether CrowdSignal is appropriate?
ATM I have pretty low requirements. True false, 5 point likert scale + open ended questions",3
I can create account and test it,3
"yes, it's problematic because HelpHub is child theme for bbPress, plus we want to have SVN and GIT in the same repo",3
"@valentinbora regarding the automation of the redirect process, we have discussed it before and there is an understanding that we didnt want to make it in batch, because we wanted to have our eyes on it. Not sure if it will change one day",3
yes I am very well aware that it’s all handmade work,3
but if there are any opportunities to automate small parts of it count me in,3
I think @atachibana had a little tool to convert Wiki style formatting to the new style too,3
https://unofficialtokyo.com/codex-converter/,3
random stumble upon,3
We should also maybe put out a bit of a celebratory post when we get over 50%,3
Afterall this migration has been going on for like... 5 years,3
(It was stuck until you took it over),3
Okay so the thing is about that and I'm so sorry for holding on to the info for so long,3
"@chanthaboune would like us to actually verify that we had higher engagement when the main WordPress twitter account pushed things out than now where it doesn't.
The assumption that having a Twitter account is just going to magically increase engagement isn't necessarily true, and it may create a discussion channel (on Twitter) that doesn't migrate back to Slack or P2",3
I don't even know if main WordPress account publish things that are specific to what's currently happening in docs team,3
(I didn't even know we have a Twitter account for docs),3
"never mind, we can publish p2 post about what we want to do at WC Asia and then share it everywhere",3
We don't have a Twitter account for Docs,3
The general direction is that the main WordPress account used to publish important news across teams. Now it doesn't.,3
That's what I meant,3
Engagement didn't seem to suffer,3
^ That's the general opinion at the top,3
I don't think it was as detailed as team members would be,3
personally I see a lot of potential but that's probably another discussion for another time,3
one question about those,3
"if someone is translating HelpHub, which badge do they get?",3
polyglots is automatic from glotpress,3
so people will not get one for translating HH,3
"Docs Team. Cause it's not just translation, they're gonna have to learn how to write good docs in their language",3
oki doki,3
They essentially become the localised Docs Team,3
similar question: if someone creates a PR for github gutenberg docs. they get a core badge,3
should they also get a documentation badge?,3
"If they already get a Core Badge, we won't double it up",3
"hm, if someone creates a patch improving the docs for a function, shouldn't he/she receive a docs badge too? (about doubling it up)",3
they automatically get core badge,3
"yep, I know, but shouldn't they receive a docs contrib one?",3
They are improving in-line docs for Core,3
"only if they do things with examples, I guess",3
We've almost gotten to the point that we no longer handle in-line docs.,3
In the similar way we no longer handle handbook changes for other teams,3
(We used to),3
"makes sense, thanks",3
"and about localized HelpHubs, that will require some locale reps, right?",3
"The previous Docs Team lead @drew has commit access. Unfortunately, I don't. So the in-line docs piece has become something that is less reachable to us.",3
"Please @Kenshino (Jon), could you explain this further? ""Docs Team. Cause it's not just translation, they're gonna have to learn how to write good docs in their language""",3
@nobnob - As you say in your profile. Language is poetry. Writing good Docs is potentially different in other languages,3
"Besides that, i do also expect the locales to follow the best practices set by the Docs Team and localise such practices",3
All right! Clear!! Thank you!,3
So do we have a consensus on how we should handle Contributor Badges?,3
@felipeelia and I agree<g>,3
"we've been discussing about the contributor badge for a while now, trying to reach a number of X micro contributions",3
in giving contributors a badge with their first contribution,3
"on my last comment there, I've suggested to give the badge right away, just as core and meta",3
no matter how small the contribution is.,3
@felipeelia I just posted an agree with you. There is precedent on other teams and make the contributor seen right away - I think it's the best onboarding tool we have,3
we would need to post a list of contributions,3
we can call the contributors to request for badge.,3
"on the handbook ""how to contribute""",3
"""Fix an article
Create meeting notes
facilitate a meeting
reporting an issue on the comment form?
Creating a PR for Gutenberg docs
user notes on code reference
write an article on HelpHub
update an article on HelpHub
migrate a page to DevHub
Report an issues 
(edited)",3
"I'm leaning towards any significant contribution. We can list down the significant contribution.
My worry is that if we say that fixing a typo is fine - we'll have a rush of requests to do that to farm badges.
We don't have a system like Core or Meta which insists on people adding patches. We'll have to individually lookin at these fixes and either add users or make the fixes ourselves.",3
"yeah, but:
People receive core/meta badges sending a 1-line patch
Coming in here and reporting the small typo does require some effort
(edited)",3
Working out how to communicate a fix to the Docs team is a significant step. even if the contribution per se is just a typo fix.,3
That is those workflows are about,3
Fair enough,3
"But the moment I see abuse, we're gonna tighten it okay?",3
"Regarding Team badge, btw, you shared a spreadsheet but that wasn't editable @Kenshino (Jon)",3
(during the last meeting),3
Yeah sorry I didn't get to reply. Adding an openly editable doc where I can't easily track which is real / which is not yet added and so on is gonna be tough. I'd suggest we setup a system where by a few of us can edit the sheet. These people should ideally be running projects within the Docs Team,3
"These people can verify that X, Y, Z should get the Team Badge",3
"How many on this team are able to give out badges? Is it just @Kenshino (Jon)? if yes, Jon, you could come up with a routine, that fits your workflow...",3
makes sense. I'd say to keep it sync with this: https://make.wordpress.org/docs/handbook/the-team/,3
"I'm comfortable with that. Which puts the onus on each project reps to get names into the doc.
I'll submit once per month",3
That's seems quite doable.,3
What are the goals of the survey? This started before I joined so I  need to do some catching up... And who is target audience?,3
And has the doc team done surveys before?,3
"General theme: ""How can we improve our user docs""",3
Not in the last 3-4 years @bph,3
"At the end of the survey, I'd like to have enough info to know what else we can do about our user docs (HelpHub) so we can directly focus our dev and content efforts in the right areas",3
Are the questions and results from the last survey archived?,3
That's the last question ^^ for today<G> on the survey (edited),3
We've never done such surveys and potentially never any. If we did it would not have been in recent years and I doubt we shoud take those as basis,3
What about a P2 to solicit questions and answer sets?,3
and other comment?,3
"As WC Asia is coming, @zzap told us it would be nice to reach an agreement on two items: Team Workflows and Badges distribution (edited)",3
@zzap are you there? Do you want to explain those items?,3
"yes, so the workflows refer to reporting an issue
we have trello board for that: https://trello.com/c/GNXYppYS/44-workflows",3
"I believe that most of workflows are covered, if not all",3
"meanwhile, I'll start google doc with the workflows we have in trello",3
"so we can work on wording and tiding up, and adding all the workflows added later",3
and hope to have that page published in the first week of February,3
"about badges, let's everyone please finish up discussion by the end of this week so I can start working on P2 proposal",3
it's here: https://make.wordpress.org/docs/2020/01/08/documentation-team-profile-badges/,3
leave your comments and questions,3
then I'll publish proposal at p2 and if we all agree we could start applying it,3
can I ask you a practical question about our team?,3
hopefully at WC Asia we'll have some new badges,3
shoot @felipeelia,3
Could we in the meantime update team badges for those of us recently joined?,3
"for example, before our meeting @nobnob pointed us an error on one of our docs. He could not fix it himself, so he came here and told us. Would he receive the docs contrib badge?",3
"(sorry for using you as an example @nobnob, I hope you don't mind)",3
@felipeelia that is exactly the subject of our discussion. What is contribution to docs team and how much of it is needed for a badge,3
and the fact that we don't know is frustrating to many contributors,3
"I'm going to chime in on this discussion. On the design team, we do triages and people who participate on triages, do not receive a badge because that is a micro-contribution",3
"Only those members with a specific project or role in the team, are the ones that receive the badge",3
those are basically the parameters for design,3
"Only those members with a specific project or role in the team, are the ones that receive the badge
This would be for the team badge, wouldn't it?",3
that's why it's important to have everyone's input and that everyone agrees,3
not sure we are talking apples to apples here... The team badge is one thing and that's what design team has.. I don't think design has contributor badges... like the docs team has or the community team has...,3
"@estelaris yep, same for us at Accessibility team",3
^^ I could be wrong about the design team..,3
we have both contributor and team badges,3
"forums team has a 1,000 replies goal to receive the contrib badge. Becoming a moderator comes with the team badge",3
@clorith I think it's actually 400 replies for contributions on the support team... (edited),3
"Our (docs) team badge seems to be simple... we have a team page, it one name's is there, he/she needs a badge (team)",3
the design contributor badge is because I am involved in a specific design project (in this case it is the re-design for HelpHub),3
"Yeah, 400 replies, we might adjust that though, it's a trial run while we try to find a good number that works",3
"(from where did I take that 1,000 number? sorry and thanks @bph and @clorith)",3
"And of course, rosetta sites have their own criteria, and they just report in to us",3
"Right, so I think we might have a better discussion when proposal is published.",3
we usually check for 400 meaningful replies too,3
"yeah, meaningful is a key",3
"alright, so I'll start working on proposal this week, everyone is welcome to continue discussion at p2",3
Contributor Badges are harder to define,3
"Team badges are easy - if you have a defined role and you're attending regular meetings, please put your name here - https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1hAPORz_yl4UTerPo8Tl5j_Xznfpm_NItrNftoXwBqvA/edit#gid=539648984",3
I will give you the badges,3
"also people who facilitate meetings and take notes should get a team badge too, correct @Kenshino (Jon)?",3
(we also should talk about these folks someday: https://make.wordpress.org/docs/pledges/) (edited),3
I'd like those people to have a specific role within the Docs Team. Facilitating meetings should be a task we all share and can be quite an entry level task to join us,3
I'm gonna share more specific thoughts around that but here are some highlights,3
"Yes, maybe it's better to leave the discussion evolve in p2 for a while so everybody have time to participate",3
"We want it to be accessible but not game-able. Setting it to any contribution to get a badge makes it too easy and it makes the badge meaningless
Team badges need to be given on a term basis. If people stop contributing regularly without cause, then they shouldn't retain team badges.
(FWIW, I can give and remove badges) (edited)",3
"yeah, discussion is going in similar direction",3
How can people contribute? - Fix an article? Create meeting notes? What else?,3
I can do an audit of the team badges and remove anyone that isn't on the team,3
"also, many folks here should have this badge a long time ago, we want to fix this",3
I'd like to give some allowance for people with great contributions to retain their team badges. E.g. Previous Team Leads etc,3
"Nice. Let's have this discussion on p2. It's also good because it gets better documented for the future as well. So anyone interested in share thoughts or ask questions regarding this matter, please leave a comment in https://make.wordpress.org/docs/2020/01/08/documentation-team-profile-badges/",3
"Custom Fields page@joyously brought the topic of Custom Fields article in HelpHub (https://wordpress.org/support/article/custom-fields/), which is missing some information on how to diplay the custom fields (original codex article: http://web.archive.org/web/20160301204600/https://codex.wordpress.org/Using_Custom_Fields)@Kenshino (Jon) and others argue that this is end-user docs and should not have this kind of information. It should have a link instead.@felipeelia suggests to link it to: https://developer.wordpress.org/plugins/metadata/rendering-post-metadata/",3
I'm with @felipeelia here. That should be in plugin handbook,3
Me too. It's actually in the Theme handbook. But that page could be extended with more complete examples,3
A side note about that page: shouldn't we decide on meta-data or metadata? We have both there.,3
good point. I would go for metadata,3
I think it's metadata in code as well,3
Yes.. never saw meta-data anywhere else,3
I use meta data when writing,3
But happy with using metadata for consistency (edited),3
Ok. second point is to remove of Bitnami in the multisite considerations article: https://wordpress.org/support/article/before-you-create-a-network/ (@René Hermenau suggested) and also do not encourage beginners to use multisite,3
@atachibana agreed with that and said he could do it if no one opposed. Do we have an opposition?,3
"+1 for removing Bitnami link
-1 for ""not encouraging beginners...""",3
"it IS a feature (a good one by the way), we just need to explain it better",3
we could also have a better documentation on multisite so that beginners can see it's not that simple,3
"Yes, that second one could be done in several ways, so it's hard to tell what is ok. Maybe it needs more discussion",3
Maybe @atachibana could make a proposition,3
Or @René Hermenau,3
"At least, we should mentions demerit",3
"I think that multisite has more than one purpose and it make sense in different ways. But call me biased 
 (edited)",3
Plugin might not run or so,3
"a good ""Pros and Cons"" list?",3
"caveats, warnings",3
Remove Bitnami,3
"Also I have a challenge on the whole ""most plugins don't work for multisite"" assumption (edited)",3
Explain which workflows fly with multisite and what are the things you might watch out for,3
"Since you can install plugins on subsites regularly, they'd work. They just might not have network settings / network activation",3
Some bad coded plugins might break. e.g. hardocoded table names... but its an edge case. Surely not most plugins,3
We explain it in our faq. pro and con of multisite -> https://multilingualpress.org/docs/wordpress-multisite-pros-cons/,3
And we divide a plugin’s compatibility with WordPress multisite into three categories: https://multilingualpress.org/docs/wordpress-multisite-compatible-plugins-the-definite-list/,3
"I'm a pretty huge advocate for default installing multisite 
 But that's also because I know WP very well and I'm a dev",3
In my opinion we should give people some examples and some downsides.,3
No marketing just documentation,3
"Big fan here too as well and have done quite a bit of work on it, would be awesome to see a run of adoption again",3
We don't want to sell the multisite feature. We want people to make an informed decision (edited),3
that's the spirit,3
"My question: Should the documentation for Gutenberg End User have a section for features only available in the plugin? They are future features for Core, so it might make sense to have a future features / changes.",3
I guess as long as it's clear that it's not available in core yet...,3
I think it should only feature Core info,3
"We can mention to every GTE of each Spanish locales to notificate them about this ideas. I only know @abrahammoca and @tokyobiyori, what do you think? (edited)",3
I think this is a good chance to work together. Dominican Republic/Honduras/Puerto Rico teams seem dormant,3
"Yes, there are many Spanish locales almost no translations.",3
Tomorrow I can find the username of every GTE from Spanish locale and mention them to talk about the collaboration in the translation milestones (like HelpHub).,3
"I think the best idea is use a channel in this Slack or a channel in the Spanish Slack, but I think this new Slack is not a good idea",3
"I believe the new space is good, but if will be better if we have a channel here, don't you think?",3
"I think the new instance can be a very nice begin, to be honest",3
I use 2 Slacks for WordPress: the global and the Spanish. I think one more it is too much,3
Create a new channel here seemed to be the solution for a non-existent problem (we have too few interactions between Spanish speakers here),3
I understand your point of view @Jesús Amieiro. It would be nice to have that feedback on the P2 post I mentioned (let me grab the link),3
I can talk with an admin of the Spanish Slack and make a channel for this (https://wpes.slack.com/),3
"I agree with @Jesús Amieiro, maybe the people get overwhelmed with three (or more) spaces.",3
@Jesús Amieiro the problem I see in create the channel in the official es_ES Slack is the limit for free spaces: just 10k messages.,3
"The messages will be lost very soon, if a person arrive late, maybe lost the chat.",3
We have a 10k limit for Brazil slack and it takes sometime to hit it,3
It actually fills faster than you expect,3
"And the history is also a good tool to find info, that's one of the benefit of having a spanish channel here.",3
We have 91k for WordPress Russia,3
The problem I see of this channel being part of a specific locale is that people from other locales will have to join a third slack anyway,3
@felipeelia The official Spanish Slack space is very active (edited),3
In the Spanish Slack you can find a lot of people from South America. This Slack is very active,3
I think a global Spanish here may be quite useful. Somehow we still need to follow through with that discussion. As a stop-gap Ali created the new Slack team.,3
"Of 13 spanish locales, I think just Spain have it active, but that space is a free one.",3
"But with a spanish channel here just for discuss topic related to translation, I think we will work very well.",3
"(Pretty much like we created a separate team for Translationday, before we got #polyglots-events  here.",3
"Please note that Spanish official slack isn't only for translation, but for all topics related to WordPress (edited)",3
"I believe that the Spanish community might need to point out the benefits around that on the p2 post that @felipeelia provided. I tried to put my point of view there, but I am not part of the Spanish community, so it won't even affect me directly.",3
"Honestly, the cooperation between Spanish speakers seemed to be very small for non-Spanish ones",3
How do you cooperate between 3 different pt_ locales?,3
And that was a problem while we were suggesting the new channel: it seemed a solution for a non-existent problem. Why to have a channel to separate a conversation that does not exist,3
"Brazilian Portuguese is very different from Angola and Portugal 
 I do know they cooperate, though",3
"I'm trying to redirect people to new space (https://spanishpolyglots.slack.com/), but I feel skepticism between members.",3
Do you see some reasons for that skepticism?,3
We could work to convince them somehow,3
"People have a lot of Slacks (I am active in 5). Not one more, please",3
"Switching between spaces is very exhausting and honestly, thats the main reason. I don't see issues in creating a new channel like #polyglots-espanish or something like that.",3
"Easier, of course, is to just join one more channel here in the global team.",3
I jump easily forth and back between 4 Slack spaces regularly. But agree totally that keeping it within one team (and with retained history) is even better. (edited),3
"Nice, we all agree with that. So, I'll kindly ask you to leave that feedback on that P2 post, that will show our interest in the new channel. In the meantime, The new slack instance will be there to help coordinate efforts",3
And somehow address what we can do to handle fears of spam and that the foreign language channel will be used for wrong things...,3
The Spanish people can report this to an admin if it occurs,3
"It's a good idea to clarify that channel will be use just for translation topics, specially sharing efforts between locale teams in translation (that's the original idea)",3
"sharing efforts between locale teams in translation
Yes! Please point that out on the P2 post too... the channel main reason is still to be clarified",3
"He did have one question for us,
I didn’t commit my db back with the code (its pretty), so I see there’s some data work to be done to get it going on the test site. If you would like, I can clean it up a bit and export?",3
Which data? Does he added any options field?,3
"I can see upsides and downsides to this- the posts should be automatically imported based on our repos, so depending on what changes he made, we may need to get him to commit his db into a different branch, so we can make sure the plugin is importing the posts the way he needs them",3
I see that new post and taxonomies are added. So I think we can commit db.,3
Yes different branch will be better,3
"Sounds like we agree then, I set up the branch https://github.com/wptrainingteam/learn-theme-beta/tree/stevedb so we can check it out, and I'll let him know to PR it over there",3
"Yesterday, I was trying to explain in a forum question about comments how the Discussion options work, but was confused a little myself when I check the current version. Because of this ticket https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/38517 that went into 5.3, it says ""comments on posts"" instead of ""comments on articles"", which implies that those options only apply to Posts. They do apply to all post types with comment support, but I think that kind of got lost in the change. I made a comment on the ticket, but it's already out the door...
I guess I was wondering either A) what can be done to prevent that happening again? or B) can it be fixed?",3
"I'm sorry, but that's... a core ticket, and not a support thing",3
"I know, but it is about support",3
"The user can't tell what the options apply to, and I couldn't state with certainty anymore either.",3
"Right, but there’s really nothing we as a support team can do about that. This is a great argument for the Trac ticket however, and that might get the developers to change their minds.
The best we can do as a support team is just make note of the change.",3
Maybe a few of you could comment on the ticket?,3
It really only shows up in support.,3
"Because all of the people that already know, don't see it.",3
"I don't think it makes sense to spam a ticket with ""yes, this"" replies. The ones who worked on it get notified when a comment is posted, so they'll see a remark was made and can look into it (time permitting)",3
"Well, when I made my comment, I saw that nobody was listed at the bottom...",3
"You don't need ot be listed to get notifications, those responsible for the components, and the ticket creator get notified by default for example",3
"OK, maybe just note somewhere that it is fallout from WP 5.3. It made that page a little more hard to understand.",3
I think our note taker might be on it?,3
"It is not, no, it's not specific enough to a particular release, and would likely result in other things breaking before this is a problem, might be worth adding to the troubleshooting steps",3
"But it's one of those ""if they don't use https, this may confuse them and cause extra failures if they try upgrading without having support for it""",3
"Yeah. Found it when I asked her to look in the console. Now with all JS going on, understanding the console is getting more important for every release.",3
"It might be worth a core ticket to have some kind of ""has-js-but-missing"" class (there's already no-js to check if JS exists at all), and have core output a warning if there's a problem loading JS",3
"Because you are right, it's getting more more important",3
"But yes, that, if you'd like to make a core ticket that would be absolutely super, I see the value in that 
 (edited)",3
I like the idea,3
I do like the idea too.,3
It would be good to have a bit better visibility on what mods in international forums can/should do in various cases.,3
But I'm not sure that anyone single person would be able to write up the whole truth on that.,3
"In general, I think there shouldn't be any difference, a mod on w.org is a mod on w.org, unless there's some distinction I'm not aware of ?",3
Or are you looking for something specific ?,3
I have my original document in the clipboard if you want me to post it here.,3
"Currently, what we have kind of like an invisible set of guidelines that Otto enforces when people email him to complain about us, so that’s why I think it would be best for him to write-up the public ones. 
 (edited)",3
"Sorry, was typing what while you asked, that’s in reference to getting some public moderator guidelines up in the Handbook.
To your question @JNash yes please post it.",3
Fundamental principles tend to work quite well...,3
"I don't see the need for this, as ""report topic"" is designed for this purpose and the modlook queue gets examined with some frequency",3
"They are harder to express the first time around, but usually it is more effective than set of rules / guidelines.",3
My only concern is that a 'modlooked' Spam is still visible and beneficial to the spammer.,3
"for a short time, yes.",3
"@JNash I really like the idea of a special role that can only mark things as Spam. There is already a Spam queue that we review regularly before purging it, and that’s exactly where marking something as Spam sends it.
@Carike Common sense is what we’ve been rolling on for years, but some users and mods have been vocal lately about “Where can I see your guidelines?”",3
To cover all the new posts as they come in to defeat spam (that's passed akismet) as quick as you want them to would require a lot volunteers all in different timezones. How many volunteers attend forum meetings? How would they know they have this new role and understand how to use it?,3
"I think we might reduce the pushback on moderation by adopting a ""no flag on first offense"" rule (unless the offense is grieveous).",3
The plugins portion I don't think is Forum territory and may be better discussed during the pluginsreview meetings.,3
maybe that could be delegated to plugin authors? They already have some special powers in their sub-fora.,3
"(I see a lot of potential, though, for ""spamming"" one star reviews)",3
"Yes, @macmanx, I thinking the spam queue for the spams. The special user or a special 'tag' filter maybe? The thing is those special users might be key to it else somebody 'public' will sooner or later mark everything they see as spam.",3
"For the queues to be served better in international forums, ticket https://meta.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/3954 would be good to have actioned.",3
"I guess the question is ""If we trust someone enough to let them mark topics, why not make them mods?""",3
"So, we already have few trusted folks who we'd give mod powers to, do we have that many we don't trust as mods that we'd rather give a bi-role to instead of making them mods (if there's a legitimate need) ?",3
"And yes, for it to be viable, you'd need folks on a wider scale from other areas, and they generally ahve their own forums they look after instead.",3
"Yeah, I’m fine with extending mod powers to folks, even if they don’t have much time. We just ask that you make an effort to attend meetings, otherwise being busy and taking breaks is fine.
With that said, if we do create a new role instead, it will be relatively easy to tie it into the existing “mark as Spam” action. (edited)",3
"I'm unfamiliar, how big of an issue is spam that passes Akismet and just sits around until someone flags it?",3
We get 2 or 3 posts per day I think that get reported as spam by users (edited),3
A lot of it is posted here.,3
"I’d say Akismet is somewhere around 60% to 70% effective on the forums right now, as far as missed spam goes.",3
@sterndata I don't want to be a mod but I also thought this 'special position' would be a good first step to be coming a mod here.,3
"> somewhere around 60% to 70% effective on the forums
and that’s due to a long history of Archiving things rather than marking them as Spam, and marking non-Spam as Spam. We’ve kind of poisoned our own well and it’s going to take a while to sort out still.",3
"I don't see the need for a step between ""trust their forum replies and behavior"" and ""let's make them a mod""",3
I do.,3
"On the other hand, a simple ""power"" such as this could drive people who normally aren't as involved into being more involved by doing simple tasks of marking spam.",3
Whether or not that's worth the trouble of creating an entirely new role though,3
"Are there any other ""simple"" tasks that could be positioned ""in-between""?",3
"I’d love a role that can only:
Mark as Spam
Approve items in Pending",3
"only those 2 things though, anything more in my mind would just be a mod",3
"I'd hoenstly not do the approval bit, marking as spam requires oversight for somethign ""bad"" to happen",3
good point,3
First item: Improve the Handbook recommendation for abbreviations and acronyms,2
It’s related to this handbook page: (edited),2
https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/best-practices/spelling/#abbreviations-and-acronyms,2
"@afercia raised this item, but I guess the idea is to ask authors to use the complet term at least the first time they use it in a post, right?",2
Yup in https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/46980 we set some new practices for abbreviations (and acronyms).,2
"Basically:
evaluate which abbreviations can be removed in favor of full text
for the other cases: provide an expansion of the abbreviation/acronym/neuronym in plain text on first use
use an <abbr> to mark up the abbreviation (which provides a hint to user agents on how to announce/display the content)
do not use a title attribute",2
"We didn’t set this in stone on the accessibility coding standards though, nor on the handbook Spelling page (edited)",2
then we should point the #docs team to this meeting summary,2
We have 23 items in 5.5 milestone: https://core.trac.wordpress.org/query?status=accepted&status=assigned&status=new&status=reopened&status=reviewing&focuses=~accessibility&milestone=5.5&col=id&col=summary&col=status&col=owner&col=type&col=priority&col=milestone&order=priority,2
"One thing I'd like to have as a goal is more aggressive work during alpha, so that we can dedicate more attention to the final product during beta & RC.",2
Looks like most of them are defects/bugs,2
"4 tickets have the early keyword, thos must be addressed as soon as possible: https://core.trac.wordpress.org/query?status=accepted&status=assigned&status=new&status=reopened&status=reviewing&keywords=~early&focuses=~accessibility&milestone=5.5&col=id&col=summary&col=status&col=milestone&col=owner&col=type&col=priority&order=priority",2
"Apart from bugfixes, it would be nice to have at least a couple user-facing accessibility improvements for 5.5.",2
"as WP 5.4 is close to Release Candidate, it will be possible to commit things into trunk (starting next week hopefully) (edited)",2
"We are keeping postponing “uniform search” since a few releases.
The “Howdy-flyout” could be a good candidate.
We still have work to do about colors (yesterday I was attending the #core-css meeting, they plan to run a CSS-admin audit)",2
are we still looking for Accessible color schemes?,2
"wow, great news",2
"Yes, I think accessible color schemes should be on the table.",2
Accessible color schemes could get some interest from other teams too. Good candidate!,2
"Uniform Search would be great, if we can get the commitment to push it through. I can't really take lead on that while also coordinating WP Accessibility Day, however.",2
I think we should also consider exploring the proposal for compact/expanded views for post tables.,2
"Color schemes tie in with the core CSS auditing, and we already have buy in from design; so that should be a high-priority goal.",2
Compact/expanded views probably needs scoping & a feature proposal.,2
"Updated list:
- Accessible color schemes
- Alternative WP List Tables views
- Uniform Search
- ""Howdy-flyout""
- Colors",2
"I think that, with this list of goals, we should consider making a multi-release plan that we would like to follow with these - they certainly won't all happen in one release.",2
I’m personally interested to (specifically) work on Accessible color schemes and Alternative WP List Tables views (edited),2
"What we probably need is somebody to take point on each project; I've already taken steps on Accessible color schemes, and am willing to take point on that. I'm happy to contribute to other projects, but can't take lead on more than one.",2
"Same here (as I’m also working on auto-updates for 5.5).
I can take care of Alternative WP List Tables views (edited)",2
Uniform search looks like a very big item… (edited),2
"Yes, well...that's why it keeps getting pushed down the list, I think.",2
Maybe we should milstone it to 5.6 and only address 2-3 projects in 5.5 (which is awesome),2
I'm fine with that; but I think it'll only happen in 5.6 if people are already working on it during 5.5.,2
And that requires somebody to step up and take lead on it. That could be @nrqsnchz - I was working on it with him previously.,2
we started this discussion last week and agreed to continue the conversation today,2
did anyone have any additional thoughts or suggestions on this topic?,2
I don’t remember what was discussed last week,2
"not a problem, I think it’s a good idea to recapitulate so we all have a bit of context",2
last week we started talking about how can we as the a11y team be more involved in the development of Gutenberg,2
"we seemed to agreed that we wanted to do more there, but we didn’t know how to. The team’s bandwidth seems to be not enough to keep up with the  pace.",2
I only have so much time and bandwidth,2
"and that’s understandable, we all can only do so much",2
How can I help?,2
"Did we actually discuss this point last week? No mention in the meetings notes, nor I was able to find anthing after a quick back scroll on this channel.",2
"it was discussed: https://make.wordpress.org/accessibility/2020/02/14/accessibility-team-meeting-notes-for-february-14-2020/
This topic led to a discussion about processes, the pace of development of Gutenberg, and communication between teams. We agreed to come back to this concern next week, and address how, if possible, the Accessibility team can be more involved in the GitHub repository.",2
One thing I noticed last week is that we’re missing the issues in GitHub that get tagged as needing a11y feedback. Some of them sit for weeks or months and then the team has to just get on with it without our input.,2
"I tried finding a way we could get notified when someone asked for feedback, but I didn’t find a good solution yet.",2
"yes, for reference, there are 40 issues that need a11y feedback: https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/labels/Needs%20Accessibility%20Feedback (edited)",2
"Ah yes we mentioned this problem but well, I’d say there was no actual broad discussion",2
"I think we discussed how those issues don't always get communicated to the right ""channel"".
Not all of us track the github issues and so just communicating it only in that channel increases the likelihood of it getting missed.",2
"Regardless, the fundamental problem is the same: this team is a small team",2
"thank you @Dani Hooven! I think one way we can all start by going over those issues and provide feedback if possible, and if not,  bring them up here in the channel so they can be discussed",2
"definitively, we don’t have a lot of resources",2
would everyone be OK if we start raising one issue per week during our team meetings?,2
"if the agenda permits, that is",2
"@nrqsnchz yep that would be a good thing. Maybe we could reserve some time in the meeting for a couple, important, Gutenissues per week.",2
We used to do that for Trac tickets.,2
Is there an automated service that can help?,2
I love that idea @afercia,2
To ping the channel when an issue has a label?,2
My recommendation due to amount would be a a11y-firehose if you did that.,2
But I'd also suggest designers and developers jump into this channel and ask questions about things. I've seen a few do that - thank you!,2
that was one of the ideas suggested last week,2
Otherwise it's a lot for those in this team.,2
@mapk Not that I’ve found yet. Getting notified when an issue is created with a tag is different from getting notified when a tag is added to an existing issue.,2
Github will notify that but it can get noisy.,2
one concern raised was the amount of noise this could bring to the channel. I honestly don’t know if that would be an issue or not.,2
"There are services like IFTTT or Zapier. But like Tammie mentioned, it could get noisy.",2
You can do a fair bit using Slack / github out of box.,2
-firehose channels help for those to dip in. (edited),2
"I’m not sure such automations would actually help that much. Many on this team just don’t have bandwidth 
 (edited)",2
"we could give it a try if folks want to. If it works we keep it, and if we find it’s too noisy we shut it down. Simple as that,",2
"A few ideas that we've done in design to help bandwidth (we have similar issues of small team):
Highlighting issues in meeting.
Calling out issues in notes based on meeting.
Triages specifically on Gutenberg.
(edited)",2
"Now I know that's a different team, but it might offer an idea.",2
what are everyone’s thoughts on this?,2
"Long term proposal: push designers and devs of all teams to dedicate some time to improve their a11y related skills 

Utopian?",2
I think we can try it but I think afercia has a valid concern with bandwidth - we ultimately need more people with a11y experience/understanding helping out,2
"Many are already improving their a11y skills, @antotrifiroconaccento. But as this team is well aware, that takes time.",2
Happy to hear that @mapk,2
"I’d say that it requires a mindset change, to start with",2
Agreed! Of which... many are already improving their a11y mindset.,2
"If not, all.",2
^ But that's me being totally optimistic there.,2
Optimism is always welcome.,2
"Ok, i’d like for us to leave with some next steps on this. Would anyone be against if we:
Started highlighting gutenberg issues for discussion in our weekly meeting and mention them in the meeting notes
Give the github-slack integration a try for a couple of weeks and see how we feel about it",2
and willingness to learn!,2
What about holding specific triage sessions here at a time for Gutenberg?,2
It could be a way to bring both teams together.,2
"@nrqsnchz I’d say to try 2 Gutenissues and include them in the meeting Agenda, as we used to do for Trac tickets.",2
That would give people a few hours to get prepared,2
what do you all think about @karmatosed idea of a gutenberg-specific triage/bug scrub session?,2
I will try and swing by the design triage meetings as well - cross-team collaboration has always been helpful. Unfortunately bandwidth and time will impact that but I will at least make an attempt!,2
"That would be great, thank you",2
I love the idea of that session being cross-team,2
"By having a11y peeps in triages it really exposes, which leads to learning by doing.",2
"yes, agreed",2
I realise time is hard so I don't want to force that to a schedule.,2
"If that means dedicating one more hour per week, I’m not sure many would have time.",2
Do they need to be each week?,2
"Maybe add this proposal to the meeting notes and re-discuss next week, to double check people availability.",2
"yep, I think we need to give folks time to think about this and continue the discussion",2
"in the meantime, we can take it one step at a time, and start by raising 2 gutenissues during next meeting",2
"awesome, I’ll add all of this to the notes so folks who could not attend be in the loop",2
should we assemble a task force to do a bit more resesarch on this?,2
"Maybe we need a better way to stay on top of the things people are asking for feedback on?
One thing I’ve been trying to do is to add one or two issues that need a11y feedback to our agendas (as you’ll see with the next item). While this may help a little, it’s definitively not enough.",2
Have we ever consider having a Slack integration thingy that posts to this channel issues that get the label “Needs Accessibility Feedback”?,2
"I’m trying to see if that’s possible, @nrqsnchz",2
Would prefer they went to a different channel; they’d be easier to resurface if they weren’t intermingled with conversations.,2
It looks like getting notified of new issues with a specific label is one thing (has label on creation) but getting notified when labels change on existing issues is another thing,2
hoe does everyone feel about that? would that channel have enough people from the team actively checking?,2
could we also spend some time during the weekly bug scrub on gutenberg issues?,2
I don’t think it’s derailing - we have a plan for dealing with this right now and we’re looking into how to handle things better going forward.,2
"I have no idea if it's possible, but can we propose a ""non visual mockup""? I mean, if we aren't interested in the visual part, can we set a possible HTML structure of what we think is the best possible structure for the editor, and move from that? I hope I have explained myself...",2
"So, if anybody here already knows about reasons why the proposed date would be an issue, please inform organizers as soon as possible.",2
"Yep. I agree. I think it's a good idea to let it sit for one meeting cycle, in case anybody suddenly realizes a major problem with it. I don't want to commit absolutely prematurely, and I think committing in early Feb. is probably fine.",2
"Otherwise, the only reason it would change is if we felt we couldn't get it done in time, and I don't think that's a current concern.",2
do we have a date for the next WPAD planning meeting?,2
"Not yet, I think.",2
"Not set yet, no. It'll be in early February.",2
I should just go propose some dates now...,2
"that sounds great, make sure you all vote for the dates that work best for you",2
(Dates proposed in #accessibility-events),2
"I think WordCamp Central twitter account is too silent, official and boring. I’d like it to raise local communities and their WordCamps more in the content of that account - this could be done by retweeting curated content.",2
There is an awesome proposal from @bph from aaaaaaages ago,2
There’s no proposal on P2 because I’m not sure how to proceed and if this is a good idea or not,2
I’ll try to find the link,2
"oh, there has been an proposal in the past. Sweet!",2
https://make.wordpress.org/community/2017/11/16/proposal-wordcamp-central-twitter-strategy-and-tactics/,2
that would be cool yeah - maybe we can work together with the marketing team on that?,2
"totally! In fact, they asked us to do so when I was on hunt for our password",2
ah cool,2
btw does anyone know that?,2
erm - im not sure - someone will have it!,2
"bph added me as a collaborator in tweetdeck and I can do the same from now on, so that’s at least something.",2
I read through Birgit proposal and it seems to me still very solid after more than two years (edited),2
The comments are also a gold mine,2
My advice would be to have a sub-team dedicated to this for multiple reasons:,2
"Own the process
Tone of voice
Documentation for legacy
(edited)",2
"And I am terrible at social media so I am not volunteering to be part of this 
 Just my .2$",2
should we arrange a cross-team Zoom call with marketing to review the old proposal and move forward with this?,2
I am observing how the WCEU Comms team work and they are acing it because they are quite aligned,2
id like to make sure we have people who are keen to actually do the work on it before moving ahead,2
so perhaps a post to gather a working group (or sub-team or whatever is an appropriate name for that sort of thing),2
its much better to move forward if we know there'll be someone to take it on (edited),2
you are absolutely right. I’ll do that post and cross-share it with marketing team to see if there’s enough interest,2
"Although I'm a little out of time, I'd like to comment that I think we should prioritize if possible the translations of the meetups and WordCamps handbooks. It would help a lot to create groups in the languages to which they may be translated.",2
Goals… There are lots of goals for the year so I wanted to make sure we had a chance to discuss them all.,2
First goal: Have a question added to WordCamp applications to indicate if you’re interested in organizing a KidsCamp,2
"The idea with adding the question being added to the application is to ensure mentors, deputies and the Youth Events teams are able to see interest and provide information quickly so organizers don’t feel forgotten or lost.",2
I think it’s a great idea.,2
It also promotes youth events to new organizers who may never have heard of one.,2
Yes… and also reminds camps to be age inclusive,2
So what does it take to get that question added to the application? Stares at @camikaos who probably knows the answer…   (My apologies if this has already been discussed.  Getting caught up!),2
part of me is wondering if it is a meta thing,2
Are you talking about wordcamp applications?,2
Yes.,2
Adding a question to the official application.,2
"If that addition is decided on community team P2, I can make the change and PR it. I'm making other changes to application forms anyways.",2
So first step would be proposing it on P2?,2
I’ve already talked with Ian and Corey about that change and also about adding a question about Contributor day,2
I’ll be making a post on the P2 shortly where we’ll want to make sure we include all requests so we can avoid making one off changes to applications. (edited),2
"Loving all this conversation!
Goal 2: Insert a KidsCamp paragraph into existing WordCamp orientation script
We almost have this locked down and @camikaos is doing an amazing job helping with edits and provided a template of sorts.",2
This goal doesn’t take any  approval beside the script insert being  ready and approved,2
Which means we are like 99% there. @camikaos is this something we should include on the P2 for discussion or just in the meeting here?,2
I’d like to see it discussed somewhere more accessible than here so any decisions being made can be weighed in on by people in all the timezones,2
so p2 would be good,2
agreed. I will post here and again on the P2,2
"Orientation
KidsCamps are a great way to engage members of the community under the age of 18. You will want a dedicated member of the community to organize, lead and direct this program. The lead KidsCamp organizer will be in charge of :
 • recruiting volunteers 
 • working with the venue organizer to gain space
 •  working with the budget organizer on any costs
 • communicating with kids@wordcamp.org on anything that is needed
A couple of  things that are different from a WordCamp are that all volunteers are background checked (at the KidsCamp, not the main event). This protects everyone involved. 
Keep in mind you will want a kid friendly after party as well. 
We will have a separate orientation with the KidsCamp Organizer and that organizer will get their own mentor if it is their first year (or they want one).",2
This is what we have so far. I will put it on the meeting notes and a separate P2 post so all can discuss and see the process,2
The above is just to get your thoughts rolling,2
Goal 3: Provide consistent mentorship for KidsCamp organizers – separate from WordCamp mentorship,2
@camikaos I believe this means we would need mentors that want to step into this role correct?,2
Yes. We would need experienced KidsCamp organizers to be available to new KidsCamp organizers,2
which brings up an unstated goal: KidsCamp mentorship documentation,2
"We have the basic mentorship schedule, but yes this is a deeper documentation need",2
So in this case the KidsCamp mentors would work directly with another KidsCamp organizer in addition to the mentor the works with the lead organizer,2
"The task is a bit smaller than a main camp mentor because it is a micro-event with less responsibility since budget, venue, etc falls on the main camp",2
How many mentors are needed?,2
At this point having 2-3 is a good starting point… right now I think I am the only one,2
Next Goal 4: Create a stand-alone KidsCamp orientation that should be given to Meetup organizers hosting kids events and the KidsCamp wrangler for WordCamps,2
This is at about a 75%. https://docs.google.com/document/d/13p4lfB64hYJG6lBfU_DL08HsyDCV-_Aupw8YWPd1C1o/edit?usp=sharing,2
I will post this on the P2 for transparency and thoughts.,2
The idea with this is for the mentors to provide the same orientation experience across the board,2
because consistency is our friend,2
"And rolling into the last goal…
Goal 5: Recruit and train 3 new members for the KidsCamp working group
The last 3 are all very closely related…",2
"Because there is a lot of documenting we are really hoping to gain at least 3 new members for the group. These individuals can be writers, researchers, mentors, etc. We have a ton of awesome things going on and so that offers a lot of roles to fill.",2
Let’s start with suggestions for community team goals. Some great suggestions there - but we are still looking for more.  https://make.wordpress.org/community/2020/01/15/community-team-goals-for-2020-suggestions-wanted/,2

i agree,2
Yes!,2
"not with fixed times tho, cause that will make vetting sprints feel like “too” usual thing. But have a target to arrange one at some point monthly.",2
Maybe have them on a certain date but at 3 different times to catch all timezones?,2
But on a random date each month,2

Please take some time to think and suggest any ideas that come to mind for what the Community Team should try to accomplish in 2020. All ideas welcome, and suggestions for regular vetting sprints and ideas for improved queue maintenance and communication with our community would make for some wonderful goals",2
I’ll try to copy mycamp.rocks newsletter #20 content about boosting ticket sales to handbook soon-ish. Hopefully so it can be added to january newsletter also. (David agreed that I can copy the tips to our handbook) (edited),2
Will look at organizing things from my side today,2
I think we already had a couple columns possibly in the migration spreadsheet and just need to pick up and go through,2
Was sort of held in lieu of getting things moved at the time,2
I will give you what I have so far this week so you can update them,2
@estelaris could be added as a tab on the spreadsheet,2
"@tomf, yes of course",2
"are there many, I think you said you've gone through 30?",2
"30 at the session and some I had reviewed earlier, we are at 71 exactly",2
do you have a round about of how many title changes?  Like a couple or a bunch?,2
so far only 2,2
@atachibana Can you review that post and I'll give bph access to Make / Docs?,2
You can review async tomorrow and chat with @bph here,2
2 things,2
@atachibana @bph can I leave the running of the creation of this survey entirely in your hands? This means we definitely need a survey to be up by 19 Feb 2020,2
"hmm, I'll be on vacation Feb 13 through Feb 19... I can work on it prior, though..",2
we probably should make the deadline sooner then...,2
sooner than 2/14,2
Let's make it Feb 12th then,2
That gives us a week to make it work,2
"Can I ask for people to participate in this small team then? Realistically, our P2 doesn't get much feedback",2
Or we can use this channel to get feedback.,2
I can help edit,2
Please volunteer to help in the notes that @zzap is writing as well,2
Actually,2
in the P2 post that @bph will post,2
Let's present our new Docs team handbook?,2
I'm working on it,2
So a few things. Because I'm part of the organiser team... I know there's significantly less people interested in the Docs table than the Core one for example. (Can't provide numbers),2
maybe too optimistic for whole Handbook but we can work on priorities for CD at WC Asia,2
"How can we make our work more interesting to people so they will come to the table? (We have to do this pre-event)
How can we make it rewarding during the event?
How can we keep them post event?",2
This is an interesting read btw by the WCEU team - https://make.wordpress.org/updates/2020/01/27/wceu-2020-leave-no-contributor-behind/#comment-4749,2
we have to tell the world that Docs is not just writing guides,2
have cookies,2
that's always a winner,2
"Joining with core team to ask people to send patches with docs?
badges?
asking people to joining in here?",2
"(and obviously, +1 for cookies)",2
@Kenshino (Jon) did we have any updates on Docs Twitter account?,2
it would come very handy for many things,2
especially promising cookies,2
"I like @felipeelia idea. There are indeed people that rush to the core-php table that would be happy to collaborate with docs patches. But this is a very limited audience though...
Maybe pairing with marketing,  training (there is a table for that, isnt there?) or other tables with non-techincal people...",2
for HelpHub we could pair with polyglots,2
they always have a lot of contributors,2
and then steal a few,2
"I had very fun convos with Polygots, Meta teams on HelpHub at WCEU in 2019",2
we could create a banner One table to rule them all and then explain why Docs are everywhere (edited),2
Hahaha,2
All of these are great - let's keep discussing but we really need to come up with an idea that we can broadcast and share with the WCAsia Contributor Day team so that they can tell attendees,2
Let's get them excited to contribute to Docs,2
"I do think a small refactor in our handbook is very important for the points that @Kenshino (Jon) brought. I remember when he was explaining to me all the Docs ecosystem in WCEU last year, it was very confusing. It shouldn't be confusing.
The more simple it seems to collaborate, the more people will engage...",2
"So if we had at least this ONE page, simple to read and understand, that gives an overview of what we do (and how awesome it is!)",2
Ha. Yeah I knew I was confusing you @leogermani,2
"for example, do we could get stats on page views for devhub and helphub.",2
"People will like the idea of having their hands on something so relevant, and viewed by so many people all over the world",2
Would a review of the new design work for the WCAsia table? I could prepare something,2
"I like the stats idea, very much, as it also allows us to prioritize updates to existing docs when things change in future releases.",2
"It would be important for me, because of the different alphabets and would like to know if it works",2
What is the first step? Random time stamp. 25 days to WordCamp Asia,2
Shall we start a asynchronous private chat?,2
I think Step 1 is to start a Google Doc in our Shared folder,2
We can have a public chat here - no need for a private one. Let's set this survey + our focus at WCAsia as the next meeting focus shall we?,2
I would love for that Survey to be ready to be distributed at WC Asia,2
So we have a month @atachibana,2
"can you please explain what is that survey @Kenshino (Jon) or @atachibana? What questions will it be, target audience, et cetera?",2
"I was hoping we'll build the questions with the general theme being ""How do you think we can improve the WordPress documentation?""",2
Some questions using the likert scale to track how good it is now so we can repeat the survey in the future. Some open fields to get proper feedback so we can define future projects better,2
"Ahh, nice",2
what would we use? Google forms? Airtables?,2
We could definitely work that out,2
We're not limited to choices but let's make sure we can do it again and compare in the future,2
We need to finish our changes ideally before WC Asia,2
When is it?,2
Feb 21,2
looks like a nice goal to me!,2
"how often do we edit our team page? It would be nice if every time we edit that page we assure that badges are ""synced"" with listed folks. Makes sense?",2
"yes, we are planning to do that",2
"looks like on every 6 months, by the way discussion is going",2
"This is something that we could have in our ""Current projects"" page, because is something good for a new contributor to step in.",2
"yes, we have it here: https://make.wordpress.org/docs/handbook/helphub/translating-helphub/
but not in current projects (edited)",2
"I mean, once everything is set up and we hve a clear workflow. But to translate end-user docs is something  good as a first contribution.",2
I think the key thing people are worried about now is keeping an eye of changes on the English docs,2
I hate that it is still manual,2
We could have a contact point between our team and the meta team to get updates on this and speak with them about this issue. What do you think? (edited),2
"there is a channel for this, #meta-helphub",2
there is a meta ticket for that too,2
we can ask there anything we want and that's the right place for that,2
Who can ask there and bring more info on this for the next meeting?,2
Best if we bring in @netweb to talk about this too,2
that's even better,2
"let's not complicate, if @netweb doesn't respond here I'll go there and ask",2
"Question: What are the most important things for each of your locales currently? What are you translating, improving, etc.?",2
for pt_BR I'd say getting more volunteers,2
"in a previous convo here on the channel, @zzap, @nao and @yui talked about it and pointed a few suggestions, including talking about it during meetups, for example.",2
"Yes, more volunteers is always important.",2
What about other locales?,2
"At this moment I am focused on the translation of HelpHub articles into Spanish (Spain, es_ES), not forgetting the maintenance of the rest of the translations (WP, plugins / themes, meta, Apps, etc.), of course",2
Anyone planning for contributor days and/or WordCamps? (edited),2
"Yes, contributor evening end of March in Antwerp.",2
"Not day, but evening, just a few hours.",2
Which is part of day 1 of the WordCamp. (https://2020.antwerp.wordcamp.org/) (edited),2
"Hi, We just plan to translate something in our last meetup, I hope we will complete it by next month.",2
"I think it would be nice to have some projects and tasks for these pledged contributors to pick up, if they are interested in doing anything outside of language translation itself. (e.g. documentation)",2
Yeah. We've got a wishlist of development that would make it easier to contribute translations.,2
This is an attempt to set a common goal as a global team & collection of local teams for 2020.,2
The “Discussion” part has some examples. I was hoping to get some brainstorming going but maybe the focus was not clear?,2
"Maybe I need to set up a form or something instead of a P2 post, so it’s easier for people to give feedback 

@khoipro @nidhijain @lasacco @Sharaz @ronak.ganatra @Afsana (edited)",2
"If you have any current/future goal for your locale team, let me know! (edited)",2
We are planning to setup wordcamp hanoi 2020 at vietnam.,2
Also wish to build a directory of all authors in VN,2
"theme, plugin, services",2
I also think about speaker potiential and want to build that data,2
"About wcasia2020, i hope to see someone from us can handle.",2
"After I wrote that measuring team success post, I wondered if if local teams’ highest focus would be in translation (or should be).
Sounds like vi team has a lot of good plans for community events and encouraging local members to publish themes and plugins on WordPress.org directory. (edited)",2
I think improving the quality is target. (edited),2
Or have any tool for bulk editing wrong string,2
"right now if i found some wrong words from wp core, search and can not find it",2
For that case.,2
Also Helphub translation is target?,2
Sure! HelpHub will be one of 2020 goals for ja,2
So any teams that want to focus on it can too (preferably after completing other major goals like core),2
"It  may be hard to set a generic one-fits-all set of goals for everyone, in fact.",2
Also have any idea to fix suggestion words?,2
"Thinking of yearly goals for various locales, we could probably try to share some examples globally. It'sgood to have goals that are both achievable and inspiring. (edited)",2
"Anyway, @khoipro I think it’d be a good idea to discuss with your team if vi wants forums, and HH will be the team’s goal",2
It’s easy to get started but hard to complete without team effort,2
Sounds like there’s a lot of good plan going for vi team though! That’s great.,2
Can we help with it somehow?,2
Some of the pending requests need gathering of information. But the Spanish ones are pretty straightforward already. It's just some not too big job that needs to be done.,2
I'll make it happen before New Year.,2
"@nobnob, @tokyobiyori, @Jesús Amieiro and I will be in an webinar this Friday. I think this count as mentoring, because each one of us will talk about different topic related with translation, from how to send a translation string to a plugin, to how to use WP Polyglots Facilitator.",2
"If this meeting is interesting for the Spanish community, I think it could be a good idea make it regularly",2
"It would be nice if we could make that part of WP Translation Day somehow, wouldn't it?",2
We can for sure stream the recording next time around.,2
This event was planned last Friday. I was on the translation table on the WordCamp Granada (Spain),2
"I mean, follow the rules of WP Translation Day.",2
"Yup, the event was re-scheduled to this Friday",2
"Actually, before I forget it, @tobifjellner told me the next meeting would happen on Jan. 1st, what can be a difficult day to attend for some of us. Can we postpone it to the week after that?",2
It would happen on Jan 8th,2
I think it's better,2
"Nice, let's postpone it then. I don't know which would be the best way to tell people about it. Perhaps a note on this meeting agenda",2
Or publishing the agenda earlier with the right date makes more sense,2
Sure! I’m looking for feedback for global and local goals for 2020,2
Might be easier for us to think about local ones first (can be very specific to your team),2
"OK next up, there were quite a few discussions at WCUS late last year about a shift of some of the focus for our team. There is a great need for training material with the specific audience of new contributors to the various teams. The scope of this would be different than what we're used to, up to actually creating video content.",2
Thanks for the update Joe!,4
Alright,4
I’m here,4
I’ll revert the PR,4

huge thanks to @Courtney P.K. and the working group for getting the global sponsors program for 2020 sorted out (edited),4
and thanks to all the companies sponsoring this year!,4
"We also have Timi sharing in the agenda - what looks like a discussion on a possible proposal P2 for adding status tags to WordCamps eg: looking for sponsor, ticket available, looking for volunteers   https://wordpress.slack.com/archives/C02RQC7RN/p1580905238135800",4
Might be a good idea to write up a post about it for further discussion.,4
And that’s all from me  - how about you? Let’s do a bit of Open Floor discussion before we wrap up. Are there any additional topics that anyone would like to bring up or discuss?,4
i like the idea of statuses for wordcamps like that (edited),4
and we are near the end of the hour!,4
"Promotions of meetups:
I think it'll be a great idea to be involved in promoting new meetup groups. I am thinking social media ads targeting the meetup communities for the first 3 months of the meetup.
Lots of people in the local community don't know about meetups in their communities because the events in some communities are not ""properly"" promoted.
Yes, meetups appear in the dashboard widget but you'll surprised as to the number of people who don't know about the widget. The promotions will also help reach people who are interested in WordPress.",4
one of the things we've been speaking about for some time is a centralised account for running ads for meetups and wordcamps (edited),4
someone has already commented on the plans for 2020 post with the idea to look into that more closely this year,4
it is a great idea and id love to see it happen,4
"its a little bit outside our team's usuall wheelhouse, but we could work with the marketing team on it im sure",4
@Sunday Ukafia The goals post Hugh mentions would  be here https://make.wordpress.org/community/2020/01/15/community-team-goals-for-2020-suggestions-wanted/ - it has a couple of suggestions for paid ads for events (edited),4
"Indeed @Hugh Lashbrooke. I raised this up in #marketing and they mentioned they'll be happy to get involved but that it's not fully within their jurisdiction.
Thanks @Aditya Kane, I'll take a look.",4
yeah - it would be some cross-team colaboration there and we should be looking further into that this year,4
Awesome! @andymci thanks for contributing to WordPress events mentoring,4
4. needs-sharing post!,4
5. Highlighted P2 posts,4
I believe it will be important to make sure WordCamps update their global sponsors if needed.,4
Lots of WC Asia work I see. Super exciting!,4

And later this evening for the Americas timezone!,4
Brill!,4
"@estelaris This is related to categorization, but not necessarily the accuracy of the content, correct?",4
Yes I think so - except ideally the audit should quickly name out the outdated pages so that translators can avoid them,4
@tomf It is both (edited),4
We only found 2 inaccurate docs and one that can be killed,4
But we only went as far as 30 articles,4
"there are 170+ articles in total, so it is going to take some time",4
"I think the IA audit can comprise for parallel actions
Content Audit - @tomf 
Information Grouping - @estelaris",4
I expect these two actions to bleed into each other regularly,4
Yes please!,4
Sorry got bit late,4
any questions?,4
"so we ""lost"" 100. is that right?",4
yep,4
"thank you so much 
 where's the script?",4
(Nice job!),4
I have a before and after screenshot saved; will check and post here,4
I have some follow up re. migration but I think i’ll wait until Open Floor,4
ditto,4
I’d love to help automate as much of it as possible,4
we could focus on that at WCAsia CD,4
@bph want to share anything on this topic?,4

Yes! thanks @zzap,4

I’d love some feedback re. 5017 for instance,4
"Yes, it was @netweb",4
"This would be really useful, because we do have a bottleneck right now",4
"Some updates. We had some progress on pt-BR docs. It's not huge, but it's something: 
5 translated pages
1 page in progress
+1 contributor last week
We will have our local docs meeting on Feb 24 and I will inform them about the Documentation badge updates as well.",4
@leogermani not sure what this is about?,4
oh the points at the beginning of the meeting,4
my ticket 5018 tunes in here too…,4
"@themiked I’ve seen you struggle with code formatting over the past few days, right?",4
@leogermani the redirect itself didn’t seem like a big deal; AFAIC it was just a shortcode insertion,4
"yes, it is. But it takes a bit of time. When you are doing many pages at once... anyways",4
(I hid some old tabs),4
"I submitted Jan's badge list last night or today morning. Once that is clear, I assume everyone that should have a badge has it and we can clear up that list properly",4
I think it'll fit our needs (edited),4
"I noticed a duplicate documentation under different categories, is that intentional? Let grab the links",4
https://wordpress.slack.com/archives/C02RP4WU5/p1580739514323000,4
@atachibana is that the code reference for functions?,4
Yes for functions,4
I have to get back working on hooks,4
One more question @atachibana - so that means 447 are fully redirected?,4
"What do you mean fully redirected?
Now, If you go to the Codex page, 1) automatically redirected to Code Reference, or 2) language locator and link exist.",4
Yup I mean sometimes we migrate pages but the examples aren't complete,4
And therefore the redirect isn't put in place,4
I see. Above 447 pages include fully examples.,4
Thank you @atachibana!,4
Let's chat a little deeper next week about that effort,4
he thought it'll take more time,4
Yes I did!,4
yes. it's here https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kZ27_w9crNpZ2gDyi58Mt2JK1gd88u94I4dwK6FR1xg/edit?ts=5e3826a8,4
I can't keep track of all these places,4
@themiked just Make / Docs basically,4
is it intended for en_* only? (edited),4
so this is about documentation of Docs team? It's not (edited),4
added a sentence to asked for volunteers,4
It's HelpHub focused,4
@themiked Yes - the international docs are the canonical source,4
Our presence at WordCamp Asia,4
Please keep chatting async anytime in this channel to talk about how we can garner more interest in WordCamp Asia's Contributor Day,4
"BTW @estelaris posted a first draft of the feedback section on HelpHub pages for people to report issues. https://meta.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/4915#comment:16 Thanks, Estela!!",4

"sorry, I keep posting in between....",4
Yes ^,4
"Workflow docs are being constructed on trello (@zzap is the one to ask for access if needed

Ah let's clarify that a little,4
That's lovely,4
"for gutenberg dev handbook, can we have a workflow defined by @pbrocks?",4
That guy is out to lunch,4
and needs to connect with @bph for marching orders,4
"lovely, please do",4
will take discussion out of meeting,4
"Thank you @zzap for creating the topic, all can share their inputs there",4
Thanks for doing that @zzap i keep dropping it from my plate,4
"sure, no problem",4
"I have a question on that matter, if you don't mind",4
we already discussed all that,4
once we have all those things defined we can add those pages to docs team handbook,4
Progress of the survey,4
was this something @bph was working on?,4
"Sorry, I've been away for a while... what survey?",4
Well actually @atachibana,4
Nope... actually I've been a bit away from that too... @felipeloureirosantos has been running this for us (pt-br community),4
We don't have updates there so far as well. There will be in the next weeks.,4
https://meta.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/2082,4
ok ok,4
you it is,4
@atachibana do you own this one?,4
"No 
 Anyone can do it.",4
for sure,4
If so @Pascal might be able to help?,4
Let's do it!,4
@bph had a question for open floor,4
"on the design front for HelpHub, the only update I have is that the design team has requested a number of changes in the mobile version, including the menu. After I present these on Wednesday, I will be able to move forward. The only missing design now, is the page for WP versions",4
"Nice, thanks @estelaris",4
first we made progress on the meta-trac ticket. https://meta.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/4915 feel free to comment,4
Hi @YordanSoares. Any Achievements & Open Floor item to share from your side? (I know you got a lot done last week!),4
Nice collaboration!,4
"So, there are a lot of work to do",4
Sounds really good. I hope many of Spanish variants will get to smoothly release 5.4 at the end of this month.,4
"Any comments, so far?",4

"We have a problem with the main page to https://ve.wordpress.org/support/, return an error. It seems to be due the fact we haven't a forum in our locale page. Maybe that topic isn't for this team, but I leave the reminder just in case.",4
There is some ongoing discussion about HelpHub and locales without a forum,4
I guess we have meta team already working on that,4
@nao and @tobifjellner can confirm that,4
At least there's a ticket for it.,4

Does anyone have suggestions on running a Meetup/Workshop for meetup organizers?,5
"In your local group, or globally?",5
"Local area of 14+ organizers: how to build group, topics, enhance sense of belonging, etc.",5
I think going over similar topics that were discussed in the Meetup Roundtables a while back would be neat!,5
https://make.wordpress.org/community/2018/05/15/report-on-the-march-meetup-organizers-roundtable-experiment/ (edited),5
"Excellent suggestion (I was a participant, yet forgot the obvious!)",5
"We certainly do a lot on this team, it's easy to lose track!",5
I think we should stop using Code names in public information,5
Unless we addrsss code name + URL all the time,5
It's important to be explained at project detailed page,5
Because those names are used in trac,5
"Other than that, I'm fine with completely removing those from public content",5
So we can’t get rid of the code names entirely,5
Those are components in meta trac,5
"What I did, for example: ""developer.wordpress.org (aka DevHub) - This is where all the documentation aimed to developers are, such as: Code reference, Plugins and Themes development handbooks and more.""",5
Or maybe we just need codenames in workflows because that's where you are going to use it,5
When you contribute,5
But we still need them,5
Unless meta change that as well,5
"In the workflows we can explain it better saying that this is referenced in trac as DevHub or HelpHub. .. and the ""aka"" mention in the more generic mentions are enough, but needed... because when some one reads that and then come to channel or read a meeting summary, he/she will know what this terms are about",5
"and then we need to get back the effort with workflows and do it! 
 we could split it! but maybe we discuss this in another meeting with more people and better connection",5
@Sunday Ukafia What's the next step here?,5
"@Sunday Ukafia that is great that you noticed this, but we are working on a new classification for the documentation",5
we are creating categories and subcategories to group all the articles in the correct place,5
"My apologies, I'll just wait for the open floor then.",5
and that will be part of the new design. you are very welcome to work with us,5
I think your connundrum gets solved in part because of the partial information architecture review @Sunday Ukafia,5
I'd love for you to help with them to provide a fresh view,5
Would you like to lead an audit into those articles? People have been reporting problems but I feel that's very reactive,5
"Sure, I think it's a good idea and I should have some time to get into that",5
The next step would be to create a survey with CrowdSignal (do we have access?) and fill it with all the questions suggested.,5
"The comments are open until Wednesday. A stated last week, I'll be on vacation Feb 13 to 19 so I can't lead this effort.",5
So what's the practical task for until 12th? Just gathering more comments/questions?,5
Yeah let's gather the question we want to ask and have a session to collate them and decide which ones we want to use,5
I think @bph can lead the effort up till that point,5
We are using the open-source LimeSurvey on WCEU (Call for Volunteers and Call for Photographers). It's a great tool as well.,5
"Looking at the previous meeting notes, I see @atachibana is the rep for the survey, once @bph is off for vacation, and @themiked is available to help. Is this ok? @atachibana, would be nice if you planned some time span for people to review the form before it goes live. Please let us know if there is anything else you need.",5
"I'm leaving that to you @zzap and @atachibana
I will be organising and can't really contribute on that day",5
besides being close to polyglots and stealing their contributors,5
"I think at the current point, we should make contributing to Docs a lot more interesting",5
"OK, we'll discuss this week and have it official before next meeting",5
does this work for you @atachibana?,5
@Kenshino (Jon) I suggest reviewing the “barriers to entry” alongside “motivational” efforts,5
Also @estelaris suggests me to organize our documentation with appropriate Categories --- Sub-Categories.,5
can you elaborate @atachibana @estelaris?,5
"@zzap, yes I’ll do it on our table",5
I'll definetly need help writing and reviewing this pages on our handbook,5
@leogermani what are the action points besides the handbook/welcome box? (edited),5
"stats.. I guess the rest is with @atachibana and @zzap, including the cookies",5
who takes care of retrieving stats? (edited),5
thank you very much for all your inputs,5
"and I need more eyes now, because it feels like all the info is there",5
I am new to docs.  I'd like to know how to suggest edits to the documentation - HelpHub.,5
"I want to help. I think we could create a ""task force"", split the pages that must be worked on.. and discuss some of the texts that need to be rewritten... (am I too optmistic?)",5
I'm not sure we (Docs) can see stats but I'm quite sure that someone can.,5
We can ask Meta for Stats,5
I was told the last time I stuck my head in that wpdb needed docs work. I can do that but I don't know what exactly is needed. Do the current docs need editing? do they need to be migrated elsewhere? Guidance is appreciated,5
also when I search for wpdb in this channel I see some stuff from last summer about it being worked on...is the current state the actual current state?,5
"second Q: what is involved in being a ""Handbook rep""? I see the plugins one is open.",5
I'll leave the docs content question for @atachibana (edited),5
"RE: Handbook Rep for Plugins, I originally wanted the Plugin team to look after that.
I gave the theme plugin handbook to the Theme Review team with the belief that they have the expertise to do it and it's in their best interest to keep maintaining it",5
"So the criteria fir the plugin handbook is basically
Proven expertise
Commitment to maintain it",5
point 2 is what I'm curious about. Is it a 10 hour a week thing? an occasional thing? would I be making proactive changes or waiting for typo reports or change requests? (edited),5
however if it's going to be done by the plugin team then I guess it's moot,5
based on the spreadsheet I assume the wpdb thing involves moving https://codex.wordpress.org/Class_Reference/wpdb to https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/classes/wpdb/,5
is that correct?,5
I believe that's what it is.,5
can someone point me at the process for getting that done?,5
https://make.wordpress.org/docs/handbook/code-reference/editing-articles/,5
thx,5
The plugin team can't do #2 basically - they are a small team who has to review tons of plugins everyday,5
"I'd say the commitment is basically -
Keeping in the loop with Core changes
Creating a team to do updates (new articles, edits, categorisation)",5
@themiked the steps are basically these here: https://make.wordpress.org/docs/handbook/code-reference/editing-articles/#compare-codex-and-code-reference,5
"I make fixes to the handbooks on a needs to be done basis essentially, so it could be a long time in between needing to do anything on them.",5
"Plugins are a bit more static than themes though, so it's an easier one to maintain",5
The Getting Started section on this page,5
"makes reference to a different spreadsheet than was given earlier, which is this one",5
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15hpEbbnuWJZ0DJafyCeG3CFRMtSxX1gY-RObrrjzzdw/edit#gid=1,5
do they track different things? wpdb isn't in the one linked from teh getting started page,5
"also, despite my horrendous spelling in this channel I am good at documentation, honest!",5
"also when I view either of them, I can read only so I can't actually reserve wpdb for myself",5
this one's being used. Take a look https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15hpEbbnuWJZ0DJafyCeG3CFRMtSxX1gY-RObrrjzzdw/edit#gid=0,5
I can't find wpdb in there,5
@atachibana will have to give you permission to edit,5
I'm happy to take the plugins handbook,5
i can provide my credentials as required although I'm not super great at blowing my own horn,5
"On workflows: @JNash has a system where he uses his site to bring up a page in a new tab from a second site for a predetermined number of seconds.
He uses it to systematically review his own and client sites for outdated / incorrect content.",5
I”m still working on a workflow,5
I'm not sure I understand @Carike,5
"It could help some volunteers in the docs team to work through .org content systematically, placing less reliance on reports.",5
It is a more pro-active approach.,5
Can you add step-by-step in our Trello board? It might be more clear then,5
"Will do 
 The TL;DR version is that it is capable of semi-automating triage.",5
"(btw, if any of you don't have access to the board, please ask @zzap)",5
Thank you @Carike,5
"Wait, one last thing",5
I've been working in the subcategory issue https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qSNKiAwLbc2nLrtGLj4Ndp4-N0daZOfgazlsSYnFXqM/edit?usp=sharing,5
"That was my first draft in trying to organize the articles, but I need help",5
I'm not too familiar with all the documentation,5
The subcategories are very important so I can find a design solution into how are we going to present them (edited),5
what kind of help with organisation do you need?,5
"the structure is done by content team, @atachibana",5
"Yes, I can give you whole contents (Please wait. Now I lost the spreadsheet)",5
so do we need to ask #content to define the subcategories?,5
One question. Why do we structure our documents by Category? Why not create page structure by Page (ex. theme handbook. https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/),5
These structure is just Parent Page > Child Page > Grandchild Page,5
Won't we have any page with more than one category?,5
Because making a theme has a process,5
So it's easy to define how it is and set an ordered structure to a theme handbook,5
But general user guides don't have such groupings - rather they are structured to how we think people will find them,5
It's very opinionated,5
Hm. but we should have. Otherwise each category has so many pages (edited),5
"But having 52 items on a list, especially on mobile is horrible for the user",5
I agree categories > sub-categories give us a better way to move things around and reorder things. Post also can be in more than one category if we want to put a guide together.,5
52 items definitely need sub-categories.,5
it is my understanding that sub-categories can be created they are just not yet displayed?,5
"Agreeing with @bph and adding to her comment, we are using breadcrumbs that will help user look for what h/s/t is looking for",5
"I agree with sub-categories if people want to further ""filter"" what they want to look for. But really, we're trying to solve a discovery issue and those won't be solved with one method.
Categorising them is a start. But a proper search system is necessary too",5
"hear, hear",5
who can I work with to help with the discovery (subcategories or other method) issue?,5
I guess @atachibana is the best one for that,5
"Yes, let's work",5
"Alright, I am doing some research now to have some examples of other solutions implemented by other software companies. I'll send you a link of my research with examples by Wednesday",5
Technically that's still under our purview (in-line docs). But because the core devs are doing it so well from the systems that @drew set- we don't have to do much about it,5
I guess its just pointing the right direction for someone who wants to contribute,5
actually when people look at a pge in DevHub they dont know that part is inline docs and part is DevHub... we have to explain that,5
I found a little worry. Should printscreen also be in the local language? this doubt has delayed me a little?,5
"Yes, it should (edited)",5
Is it just outdated from that perspective?,5
"It also must link to the new i18n page on Commons API handbook and remove all duplicated content from there, focusing on only what is specific to plugins",5
I don't think anything is specific at the i18n plugin front other than what the Polyglots team does with plugin translations,5
"Specific headers, this kind of stuff needs to be there, right?",5
"just how to load text domains, and how the workflow with translate.wordpress.org works",5
I promised to take a look at that page so I came to 2 conclusions:I should stop promising thingsI'll add that to my todo list,5
I guess that can be done at some point. Even without that: It's a good thing to maintain the gutenberg plugin translated. You can always reuse strings from there into core after merging.,5
question about what @yui just said: hopefully new Gutenberg translations will be merged into core again  - into core again? So how is Gutenberg translation managed when merged to core?,5
Gutenberg is a feature project where things are developed that later get merged into core,5
new translated (current) strings from Gutenberg plugin are merged into wp/dev on creating it for new branch,5
"A couple of times, someone has centrally merged translations from Gutenberg plugin to Core, for our convenience.",5
ownership (translator name) is preserved,5
"So translation starts in feature development, and continues in core,?",5
"If your locale has Gutenberg translated, you dont have to worry with transferring new strings to core",5
"His strings will get into core as ""current"", no need to approve them, however you may check them if core translation guidelines are stricter than plugin ones",5
Makes sense! And the translation happens at translate.wordpress.org and not over at Github?,5
everything happens at translate.w.org :),5
We (polyglots) are not obliged to use GitHub :),5
Great. Do you cooperate between several es_ locales?,5
"Yes, mainly with es_VE (Venezuela), along with @YordanSoares",5
"That's good. I don't know yet if it has been fully solved how to publish HelpHub but still use the ""global Spanish"" forums.",5
We are in the first stage of cooperation,5
"Sorry i am not sure is it the right place to asking this question, How can i contribute this page content",5
https://ta.wordpress.org/,5
It is have some mistakes,5
https://translate.wordpress.org/locale/ta/default/meta/wordpress-org/,5
You'd need to be appointed a role with the locale Rosetta site.,5
"+ partially other meta projects, such as meta/rosetta",5
Primarily you should ask one of the Locale Managers listed in https://make.wordpress.org/polyglots/teams/?locale=ta_IN to promote you (edited),5
Everyone can suggest fixes or new translations. Even without special permissions. (edited),5
"... if you get no response, then post a request for LM status in make.wordpress.org/polyglots",5
"And also, as @yui indicated: big chunks of what you see in a Rosetta site is actually translated under the meta projects.",5
"It should be ""GTE"" not ""LM"", because if translation, not publishing. It can be even PTE role for respective meta project (edited)",5
"+ note that updates to meta project translations are not deployed immediately, sometimes, due to caching, it can take up to 3 days to see them live",5
"Dealing with Rosetta content (except standardized content that is translated via meta) is a site role, LM or editor, etc.",5
Haha it works. But sometimes suggestion is wrong.,5
It is good if we hotfix it.,5
Like google translate does,5
"""Improve this suggestion""",5
"Suggestions are based on previously accepted translations. If you approve a new (correct) translation, it should come up first. (I need to find clarification on this)",5
I knew it comes from previous.,5
But is it base from same project or others?,5
Globally?,5
"1st - same project, 2nd - all other projects for same locale",5
"Rejected translations don’t disappear from translation memory.
https://wordpress.slack.com/archives/C02RP50LK/p1560323344204700?thread_ts=1560322846.196700&cid=C02RP50LK",5
(this needs to be documented),5
"ok great, i will talk about that improving lately when I have more time to figure it out!",5
@nao do you have any starter guide for working with Helphub?,5
Its in docteam meeting summary Kenshino (Jon) said its ok to set docteam contributor badges for people who help with HH localization,5
"Another question, is Helphub hosted in same domain wordpress.org or vi.wordpress.org (if completed)? (edited)",5
HelpHub URL will be something like vi.wordpress.org/support/article/…,5
It seems in https://vi.wordpress.org/wp-admin/users.php i can’t find a filter for helphub role.,5
"seems not adding, right?",5
This row.,5
"HelpHub is enabled on forum site and accessible via forums backend LOCALE.wordpress.org/support
not the main site",5
"Yes, it needs to be enabled first, but on forums site.",5
"oh, but if my language is not enable support?",5
There been a ticket about enabling HH to work with locales that dont have forum.,5
You still have to create a meta trac ticket to enable HH for your locale.,5
"Yes, i’ve created!",5
https://meta.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/4877 Here’s the one Yui mentioned.,5
Is there any default terms to translate to Korean in common?,5
"Hmm, I don’t see Korean glossary or style guide listed here.
https://make.wordpress.org/polyglots/handbook/tools/glotpress-translate-wordpress-org/list-of-glossaries-per-locale/
@devssay will know better.",5
"Thank you! 
 @nao But I can't find Korean's. I'll find another.",5
"For these mentoring circles, it would be nice if we could make it here so Brazilians can take some advantage from it too 
 (edited)",5
As for mentoring. Anyone can ask questions here anytime. But if you feel that you've got a lot of questions then why not ask for a buddy here.,5
And afterwards: give back ideas on how to streamline onboarding → handbook,5
"I still don't connect my spreadsheet, should I upload it in my Google Drive and then give you the sharing link?",5
"Team, Please add me to the trello board and github organization. I have submitted the form already. thanks",5
Please add me in Trello and Github,5
"A few of us here today are asking how they can get started contributing. If you haven't yet, get started by reading each article in our Getting Started section: https://make.wordpress.org/training/handbook/getting-started/",5
"@Ravinder Kumar has a great question, Who are we going to train?",5
"I want to contribute to the theme, can I have access to trello?",5
"For those of you asking how to get started, you can choose any lesson plan in the Next Up column on Trello, or if you have a specific area of expertise you'd like to contribute, you can create a new lesson plan by forking the lesson plan template https://github.com/wptrainingteam/repo-template",5

Hi everyone (edited),0
"No worries, thank you for using weekend time on it!",0
"I have to admit that I forgot Julie was on holiday, so I'm kind of winging it here as far as the agenda goes.",0
That’s fine,0
What a quiet meeting,0
I’m jealous of those on holiday,0
I'm on holiday too,0
I’d totally switch off if I was on holiday,0
We might have the dubious honor of fastest meeting ever then!,0
lettuce begin,0
<-- not guilty (edited),0
"all these young whipper snappers, coming here, taking our UI",0
they took our UI!,0
Lurking while working!,0
"Arrow keys for moving between tabs sounds correct, but not tabbing to access the tab’s content.",6
"I think the ARIA tabs pattern is good when there are many tabs.
When they’re just two, it tends to be overkill. This was already discussed months ago while working on the Sidebar and the decision at that time was to not treat them as ARIA tabs.",6
"and in the case where there will be more than two tabs, should we adopt the ARIA tabs pattern?",6
"We added a hidden selected text at that time, if I recall correctly.",6
I don’t think the pattern should change based on the number of tabs - it should be consistent. But how often is it just two tabs and how often it is more? (edited),6
I’m not aware of any usage other than this one.,6
"I found these two examples, both use arrows for navigating but one is manual activation and the other is automatic;: https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices-1.1/examples/tabs/tabs-1/tabs.html and https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices-1.1/examples/tabs/tabs-2/tabs.html",6
"If this is the only tab-panel like UI in Gutenberg, then I don’t think the change would be advantageous.",6
"Current rendered markup, for reference:
<ul>
 <li>
  <button type=""button"" aria-label=""Document"" data-label=""Document"" class=""..."">Document</button>
 </li>
 <li>
  <button type=""button"" aria-label=""Block (selected)"" data-label=""Block"" class=""... is-active"">Block</button>
 </li>
</ul>",6
"If there are others, then it could be a useful reproducible pattern; on its own, it just introduces another new way of interacting that won’t be repeated elsewhere - and that seems like a problem.",6
"It is good to have as a component that can be used in other parts of the admin though. In a far future, when the admin will be refactored.",6
"Sure. And perhaps at some point in the future this change could make sense, but I don’t see it as useful now.",6
"For the records: in 5.3 we introduced ARIA tabs in the media modal, with manual activation.",6
"From my personal point of view, tabbing to enter a panel content is counter intuitive, so I would stay with the current implementation.",6
Tabbed interfaces are used in the various operating systems to start with. They’re well known to pro keyboard users,6
The design team has requested our feedback testing the navigation block; @nrqsnchz has set up a spreadsheet for us to log testing results in: https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/9457,6
Sorry - wrong link.,6
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1yFCFlPK78Ryl7WT9iRhn4Xe0PpWvnzAKSzBLi6L8GHY/edit?usp=sharing,6
"Please, if everybody can take even 15 minutes to try out the navigation block and provide some feedback, that would be greatly appreciated!",6
"It's in Gutenberg 7.0, so if you have the plug-in installed you should have access to it.",6
I don't know the status of more recent changes; but I'll find out if there are any critical patches that might be good to test using gutenberg.run,6
"I think that besides changing the survey questions, we should add banners to all wp.org sites asking people to answer the survey",6
thanks to everyone who has hsared feedback on that project already,6
"and besides that, to add another message in the WP dashboard asking people to answer it",6
yeah those could be good options,6
"message in dashboard would need coordination with core team, correct?",6
yeah it would,6
"im not 100% sure on that because the survey is for meetup attendees, which most WP users are not",6
its worth discussing though,6
That might inspire them to join their local meetup,6
yeah true,6
at least the wp.org banner is good idea and should be fairly easy to add as there’s already banner for the general survey,6
It’ll be great if the tool can show a feedback link in the schedule page right after the session (based on session time). So emcees can announce for audience to review and the feedback can be instant.,6
"https://wordpress.slack.com/archives/C02RP4WU5/p1581351749166800
I've got feedback on this.",6
@Sunday Ukafia What feedback?,6
We expanded the the overview documentation,6
"If you click the above link, you'll see I made a suggestion in the last meeting open floor and you asked how I want to help address that.",6
I wanted to migrate a few pages myself just to see how the process goes and stumbled upon quite some out of sync rows in the Migration Sheet,6
"for reference and newcomers, the sheet is here https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15hpEbbnuWJZ0DJafyCeG3CFRMtSxX1gY-RObrrjzzdw/edit#gid=0",6
"specifically in the Functions sub-sheet, I found rows that were Done (i.e. migrated) but not marked as such, as well as marked as Done but not migrated",6
so i wrote some quick code to check all rows and correct the statuses,6
"IIRC, there were around ~150 migrated but not marked, and about ~250 “actually not migrated”",6
"for the latter, you can see those on the Cross-check column K marked orange",6
"there’s also about 10-15 pages that were waiting for Trac issues, some of which are fixed and closed now",6
my little script checks the Trac issue status too,6
"anyway, let me conclude my story here",6
"@zzap this reminds me of something someone was working on, regarding making it easy to set up the Helphub environment so it would be easier for new devs to help",6
"I was thinking. It would be much faster if we could just mark a page ""ready for redirect"" and let a script to the job. If possible, I think it's a good idea. Not sure if it's easy because we have to check if there is a language locator or not...",6
So about the badges. we have this doc to track https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1hAPORz_yl4UTerPo8Tl5j_Xznfpm_NItrNftoXwBqvA/edit#gid=539648984,6
"It's a little complicated with the multiple tabs and what not.
I suggest we simplify it to just 2 tabs
Team Badge
Contributor Badge
Any project leads can add contributors onto the tab. I'll just submit it without question. I'd rather work with trust
Any Team Badge can also be added by a project lead but I'd like there to be a proper justification (a column e.g. Theme Review Handbook Team, HelpHub Team etc)",6
@Kenshino (Jon) We could add a reminder to have an item on the agenda periodically to review the Team members. @zzap suggested 6 months in her doc. But we could have checkpoints more often,6
"Does anyone have anything to add about the user survey? I'll drop some desc in here written by @bph to refresh everyone's minds
The goal of this specific survey is to learn ""How complete are our documentation and how can we improve our user docs?""",6
grumbles that 2 or 3 questions about how localized HH can improve wouldn't hurt,6
@felipeelia: Yes it would not hurt,6
@felipeelia that's an excellent point. Maybe you can add examples of the questions later to the post...,6
"If someone has comments regarding the feedback section post them on the ticket  mentioned here
https://wordpress.slack.com/archives/C02RP4WU5/p1580745947400700",6
"I would call this a micro-contribution, and we could as a team decide 5 of those micro interactions earns you a contributor badge.",6
"yes, something like that",6
"yeah, I like that idea, the problem would be keep track of those, right?",6
How would you feel about that @nobnob?,6
we would also need some document for tracking,6
"but I'd also like to add idea of having some kind of ""tutor""",6
"Convince .org to install GamiPress.
That would solve so many problems...",6
I thought of that.... and don't have a good answer,6
more like someone who's tracking your progress and giving you directions,6
"normally the contributor could keep track of it and let us know, when the threshold is reached...",6
"Really I don't mind a badge or 10
But, it's a recognition that love those who collaborate",6
"yes, it's very difficult to measure",6
I'd love to have more opinions there in comments so we can draft a proposal,6
a question: WP survey is closed already?,6
maybe its time to remove those red banners? :),6
"Also, it would be AWESOME if we could have some trade between Spanish speakers here on this very channel. (edited)",6
And also a flyer,6
"If we get table, we can create list of open issues like we did for #wceu",6
"Yes absolutely, that was really helpful for getting the most value from our contributors",6
"Nice. That should make life easier, right?",6
"I hope so 
 It maye also lead to more users discovering it and being confused though",6
"Also, “fixed” here is relative. There are fixes out, but considering how many sites it hit, we’ll probably be seeing threads for a while.
(hopefully folks have learned to delete importer plugins when they’re done with them)",6
Hmm. There are so many people that build a site and then leave without maintenance for years...,6
I'm not sure what was inappropriate about the discussions about the plugins that had security vulnerabilities?,6
Especially commercial plugins/themes may never get updated.,6
yeah that's irresponsible of them,6
"I’m not sure what was inappropriate about the discussions about the plugins that had security vulnerabilities?
It wasn’t those plugins.",6
I think there's a number of users who just don't understand that for premium themes they need to continue to pay for updates.,6
